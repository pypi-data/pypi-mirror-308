**RAGSkeleton** is a modular, foundational framework designed to streamline the creation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. By combining retrieval mechanisms with language model generation, RAGSkeleton enables developers and researchers to build adaptable, context-aware solutions across diverse domains. This framework offers a flexible structure to retrieve relevant information from document databases, generate precise responses to user queries, and easily incorporate domain-specific models and retrieval methods. RAGSkeleton serves as an intuitive foundation for applications in natural language understanding, question-answering, and document-centric AI tasks.

## Key Features

- **Modular Structure:** Allows for easy customization and integration with various models.
- **Domain Flexibility:** Supports diverse applications, from scientific literature to customer support.
- **Compatibility:** Works with both local and cloud-hosted language models.
- **Scalability:** Built to support scalable document processing and information retrieval.
