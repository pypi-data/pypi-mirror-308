# üî• Brainrot Python Module 

A totally bussin' Python module that replaces boring built-in functions with Gen Z slang. No cap fr fr.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WORK IN PROGRESS** - This module is still cooking, bestie! Might have some no cap moments.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install py_brainrot
```

## üöÄ Usage

```python
from brainrot import *

# Print something (it's giving yap energy)
yap("This is bussin fr fr")

# Get string length (count the rizz)
rizz_counter("sheesh")

# Get user input (pass the vibe check)
user_input = vibe_check("What's the move? ")

# Find maximum value (most giga chad number)
giga_chad([1, 2, 3])  # returns 3

# Find minimum value (beta behavior)
beta([1, 2, 3])  # returns 1
```
