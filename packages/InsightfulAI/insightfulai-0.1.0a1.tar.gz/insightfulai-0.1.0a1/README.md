## 📋 Project Overview

**InsightfulAI** aims to make machine learning development simpler by offering pre-built templates for common ML tasks. These templates are flexible, allowing you to adapt them for a wide range of projects:

- **Classification Models**: Ready-to-use templates for building classifiers, including binary and multi-class classification.
- **Regression Analysis**: Templates for predictive tasks with continuous outputs.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Tools for text classification, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition (NER).
- **Anomaly Detection**: Templates for detecting unusual patterns or outliers.
- **Data Preparation Pipelines**: Scripts to streamline data cleaning, feature engineering, and data augmentation.

Each template includes code, setup instructions, and usage examples to get you started quickly and efficiently.
