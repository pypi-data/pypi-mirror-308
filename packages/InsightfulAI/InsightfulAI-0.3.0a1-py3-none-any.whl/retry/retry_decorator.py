"""
InsightfulAI - Retry with Exponential Backoff Decorator
=======================================================

Project: InsightfulAI

Description:
This module provides a decorator function, `retry_exponential_backoff`, which applies retry logic to any function. 
When an exception is raised during the function's execution, the decorator retries up to a specified number of attempts, 
with an exponentially increasing backoff time (2^attempt seconds) between retries. If all retries fail, an error 
is logged, and the exception is raised.

Usage:
Apply `@retry_exponential_backoff` to functions where transient errors may occur (e.g., network calls, database queries).
This will log each retry attempt, wait with exponential backoff, and ultimately raise an error if retries are exhausted.

Parameters:
- `func` (callable): The function to wrap with retry logic.

Example:
```python
@retry_exponential_backoff
def risky_operation():
    # Code that may raise an exception
    pass
