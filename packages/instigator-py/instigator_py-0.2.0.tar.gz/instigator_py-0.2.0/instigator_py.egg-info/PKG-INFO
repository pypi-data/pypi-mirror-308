# Instigator Py

This PYPI package as on https://pypi.org/project/instigator-py/0.1.0/  generates templates and provides a CLI interface.

Create your own package called instigator_py with an interactive CLI that prompts for project details

The package will help users set up boilerplate configurations for a Django or Python project by answering questions and generating a folder structure and files based on those inputs.

```
pip install instigator-py==0.1.0

```
