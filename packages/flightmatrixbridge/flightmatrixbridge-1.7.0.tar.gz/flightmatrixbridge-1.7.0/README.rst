## Installation

Download the software from [Flight Matrix](https://gamejolt.com/games/flightmatrix/933049).

To install the **FlightMatrixBridge (API)**, simply use pip:

```bash
pip install flightmatrixbridge
```

Make sure your system has Python 3.8+ and supports the `multiprocessing.shared_memory` module.

## Usage

### Initializing the FlightMatrixBridge

To initialize and start using the **FlightMatrixBridge**, create an instance of the `FlightMatrixBridge` class and specify the resolution of the frames you want to handle:

```python
from flightmatrix.bridge import FlightMatrixBridge

bridge = FlightMatrixBridge(resolution=(1226, 370), noise_level=0.01, apply_noise=False)  # Set frame resolution (width, height), noise level, and noise application
```

### Units

The system uses the following units for sensor data:
- Length: centimeters (cm)
- Angular values: degrees (°)
- Angular velocity/ gyroscope readings: degrees per second (°/s)
- Acceleration/ accelerometer readings: centimeters per second squared (cm/s²) 
- Magnetometer readings: unit vector
- LiDAR data: centimeters (cm)
- Collision detection: centimeters (cm)
- Timestamp: milliseconds (ms)

### Axis System

The axis system differs slightly between the software interface and the API. Below is a detailed explanation for both.

#### Inside the Software

When adjusting camera positions or configuring movement multipliers within the software, the following axis system is used:

| Direction | Axis |
|-----------|------|
| Forward   | Y    |
| Backward  | -Y   |
| Left      | -X   |
| Right     | X    |
| Up        | Z    |
| Down      | -Z   |

Rotation values are in degrees and are labeled roll, pitch, and yaw:

| Rotation | Axis |
|----------|------|
| Roll     | X    |
| Pitch    | Y    |
| Yaw      | Z    |

**Axis Orientation:**
```
       Z (Up)
        |
        |
        |
        O------ X (Right)
       /
      /
     Y (Forward)
```

#### In the API

The API uses a different axis system for movement commands and sensor data:

| Direction | Axis |
|-----------|------|
| Forward   | X    |
| Backward  | -X   |
| Left      | -Y   |
| Right     | X    |
| Up        | Z    |
| Down      | -Z   |

Rotation values are in degrees and are labeled roll, pitch, and yaw:

| Rotation | Axis |
|----------|------|
| Roll     | X    |
| Pitch    | Y    |
| Yaw      | Z    |

**Axis Orientation:**
```
       Z (Up)
        |
        |
        |
        O------ Y (Right)
       /
      /
     X (Forward)
```

### Logging Functions

You can configure logging based on your needs. The logging system provides flexibility to output logs either to the console or a file, and supports different log levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `SUCCESS`).

```python
# Set log level to 'DEBUG'
bridge.set_log_level('DEBUG')

# Enable logging to file
bridge.set_write_to_file(True)
```

### Flight Matrix API

The core functionalities include retrieving frames, fetching sensor data, and sending movement commands.

#### Getting Frame Data

You can retrieve frames from both the left and right cameras. You also have access to depth and segmentation data.

```python
# Retrieve right camera frame
right_frame = bridge.get_right_frame()

# Retrieve left camera frame
left_frame = bridge.get_left_frame()

# Retrieve z-depth for the right camera
right_zdepth = bridge.get_right_zdepth()

# Retrieve segmentation frame for the left camera
left_seg = bridge.get_left_seg()
```

#### Fetching Sensor Data

The bridge allows real-time access to sensor data from the shared memory block. This data includes location, orientation, velocity, acceleration, and more.

```python
sensor_data = bridge.get_sensor_data()
print(sensor_data)
```

#### Sending Movement Commands

To send movement commands (position and orientation) to a system, use the `send_movement_command` method.

```python
# Send movement command (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw)
bridge.send_movement_command(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3)
```

### Resolution & Noise Configuration

You can adjust the frame resolution dynamically and control noise levels applied to sensor data.

```python
# Set a new resolution for frames
bridge.set_resolution(1280, 720)

# Set noise level for sensor data
bridge.set_noise_level(0.05)

# Enable or disable noise application
bridge.set_apply_noise(True)
```

### Timestamp Utilities

The `utilities.py` file provides functions to convert timestamps from milliseconds into human-readable formats and to `datetime` objects.

```python
from flightmatrix.utilities import timestamp2string, timestamp2datetime

# Convert timestamp to string
timestamp_string = timestamp2string(1633029600000)
print(timestamp_string)  # Output: '2021-10-01 00:00:00:000'

# Convert timestamp to datetime object
timestamp_dt = timestamp2datetime(1633029600000)
print(timestamp_dt)  # Output: datetime object in UTC
```

## Detailed Functionality

### Initialization

Upon initialization, the `FlightMatrixBridge` class sets up shared memory blocks for frames, sensor data, and movement commands. It also configures the resolution and frame shapes.

### Shared Memory Management

The shared memory blocks are initialized using `multiprocessing.shared_memory.SharedMemory`, providing fast, low-latency access to the data. Each memory block corresponds to specific data types like frames, sensor readings, or movement commands.

The memory block names and their associated data are defined in the `memory_names` dictionary within the `FlightMatrixBridge` class:

- `right_frame`: Stores the right camera frame.
- `left_frame`: Stores the left camera frame.
- `right_zdepth`: Z-depth map for the right camera.
- `left_zdepth`: Z-depth map for the left camera.
- `right_seg`: Segmentation data for the right camera.
- `left_seg`: Segmentation data for the left camera.
- `sensor_data`: Sensor data shared memory.
- `movement_command`: Memory block for sending movement commands.

### Frame Handling

Frames can be retrieved from the shared memory using the `_get_frame` method. The frames are stored as NumPy arrays and can be either 1-channel (grayscale) or 3-channel (RGB).

### Sensor Data Handling

The `get_sensor_data` method retrieves sensor readings from the shared memory. The sensor data includes:

- Location `(x, y, z)` in *centimeters*
- Orientation `(roll, pitch, yaw)` in *degrees*
- gyroscope `(x, y, z)` in *degrees per second*
- accelerometer `(x, y, z)` in *cm/s^2*
- Magnetometer readings `(x, y, z)` in *unit vector*
- LiDAR data `(LiDARForward, LiDARBackward, LiDARLeft, LiDARRight, LiDARBottom) or (Y, -Y, -X, X, -Z)` in *centimeters*
- Collision detection status `(True/False, LocationX, LocationY, LocationZ)` in *centimeters*
- Timestamp in *milliseconds*

### Movement Command Management

Movement commands are written to shared memory using `send_movement_command`. These commands include the position and orientation of the system and are stored as six floating-point values.

### Logging

The logging system is highly configurable and provides essential feedback about the system's operations. You can adjust the verbosity of the logs and decide whether to write them to a file.

### Noise Application

To simulate real-world noise in sensor data, noise can be added using Gaussian distribution. This feature is optional and can be enabled/disabled dynamically.

## Examples

### Example 1: Fetching Frames

```python
import cv2
from flightmatrix.bridge import FlightMatrixBridge
from flightmatrix.utilities import timestamp2string
import ultraprint.common as p

# Initialize the FlightMatrixBridge
bridge = FlightMatrixBridge()

# Start a loop to continuously fetch and display frames
while True:
    # Fetch the left and right frames
    left_frame_data = bridge.get_left_frame()
    right_frame_data = bridge.get_right_frame()

    # Fetch the z-depth frames for both left and right
    left_zdepth_data = bridge.get_left_zdepth()
    right_zdepth_data = bridge.get_right_zdepth()

    # Retrieve the actual frame arrays and timestamps
    left_frame = left_frame_data['frame']
    right_frame = right_frame_data['frame']

    left_zdepth = left_zdepth_data['frame']
    right_zdepth = right_zdepth_data['frame']
    
    left_timestamp = left_frame_data['timestamp']
    right_timestamp = right_frame_data['timestamp']

    # Convert timestamps to human-readable format
    left_timestamp = timestamp2string(left_timestamp)
    right_timestamp = timestamp2string(right_timestamp)

    # Display the frames in OpenCV windows
    cv2.imshow("Left Frame", left_frame)
    cv2.imshow("Right Frame", right_frame)

    cv2.imshow("Left Z-Depth", left_zdepth)
    cv2.imshow("Right Z-Depth", right_zdepth)

    # Print timestamps for each frame (optional)
    p.purple(f"Left Frame Timestamp: {left_timestamp}")
    p.purple(f"Right Frame Timestamp: {right_timestamp}")

    # Print timestamps for z-depth frames (optional)
    p.lgray(f"Left Z-Depth Timestamp: {left_timestamp}")
    p.lgray(f"Right Z-Depth Timestamp: {right_timestamp}")

    # Break the loop when 'q' is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release OpenCV windows
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Example 2: Sending Movement Commands

```python
from flightmatrix.bridge import FlightMatrixBridge

# Initialize the bridge
bridge = FlightMatrixBridge()

# Send a movement command (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw)
bridge.send_movement_command(0.5, 1.0, 0.8, 0.0, 0.1, 0.2)
```

In order to reset/stop the movement, you can send a command with all zeros:

```python
bridge.send_movement_command(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
```

### Example 3: Fetching Sensor Data

```python
from flightmatrix.bridge import FlightMatrixBridge

# Initialize the bridge
bridge = FlightMatrixBridge(resolution=(1226, 370), noise_level=0.01, apply_noise=False)  # Set frame resolution (width, height), noise level, and noise application

# Fetch sensor data
sensor_data = bridge.get_sensor_data()

# Check for errors
if sensor_data.get('error'):
    print("Error fetching sensor data:", sensor_data['error'])
else:
    # Extract sensor readings
    location = sensor_data['location']
    orientation = sensor_data['orientation']
    gyroscope = sensor_data['gyroscope']
    accelerometer = sensor_data['accelerometer']
    magnetometer = sensor_data['magnetometer']
    lidar = sensor_data['lidar']
    collision = sensor_data['collision']
    timestamp = sensor_data['timestamp']

    # Display sensor data in a readable format
    print("Sensor Data:")
    print("-----------------------")
    print(f"Timestamp: {timestamp} ms")
    print(f"Location (cm): X={location[0]:.2f}, Y={location[1]:.2f}, Z={location[2]:.2f}")
    print(f"Orientation (degrees): Roll={orientation[0]:.2f}, Pitch={orientation[1]:.2f}, Yaw={orientation[2]:.2f}")
    print(f"Gyroscope (deg/s): X={gyroscope[0]:.2f}, Y={gyroscope[1]:.2f}, Z={gyroscope[2]:.2f}")
    print(f"Accelerometer (cm/s²): X={accelerometer[0]:.2f}, Y={accelerometer[1]:.2f}, Z={accelerometer[2]:.2f}")
    print(f"Magnetometer (unit vector): X={magnetometer[0]:.2f}, Y={magnetometer[1]:.2f}, Z={magnetometer[2]:.2f}")
    print(f"LiDAR Data (cm): Forward={lidar[0]:.2f}, Backward={lidar[1]:.2f}, Left={lidar[2]:.2f}, Right={lidar[3]:.2f}, Bottom={lidar[4]:.2f}")
    print(f"Collision Detection: Status={collision[0]}, Location (cm): X={collision[1]:.2f}, Y={collision[2]:.2f}, Z={collision[3]:.2f}")

```

### Example 4: Drone Controller

```python

from flightmatrix.bridge import FlightMatrixBridge
from flightmatrix.utilities import DroneController

# Example Usage
bridge = FlightMatrixBridge()
drone = DroneController(bridge)

# Move forward by 1.0 (positive y-axis)
drone.move_forward(1.0)

# Ascend by 0.5 (positive z-axis)
drone.ascend(0.5)

# Rotate in yaw by 0.3
drone.rotate_yaw(0.3)

# Stop only rotation (keep movement intact)
drone.stop_rotation()

# Stop all movement and rotation
drone.stop()

# Hover in place and rotate at 0.5 speed for 5 seconds
drone.hover_and_rotate(0.5, 5)
  
```

### Example 5: Data Recorder

```python

from flightmatrix.bridge import FlightMatrixBridge
from flightmatrix.utilities import DataRecorder
import time

# Example usage (Record data each second for 120 seconds)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    bridge = FlightMatrixBridge()
    recorder = DataRecorder(bridge, base_dir="Sample_Recordings", 
                            record_left_frame=True, 
                            record_right_frame=True, 
                            record_left_zdepth=True,

                            record_sensor_data=True,
                            record_sensor_data_interval=1)
    
    recorder.start_recording()

    time.sleep(120)  # Record for 120 seconds

    recorder.stop_recording()
```

## Data Streaming with DataStreamer

The `DataStreamer` class provides a convenient way to stream data from the Flight Matrix system using callbacks. It allows you to subscribe to specific data streams (e.g., left frame, sensor data) and specify callback functions that are called whenever new data is available. Each data stream runs in its own thread, enabling parallel data fetching without one stream waiting for the other. You can also specify the interval at which data is fetched or set it to zero for the fastest possible streaming.

### Features

- **Subscribe to Data Streams**: Subscribe to specific data types you are interested in.
- **Parallel Data Fetching**: Each data stream runs in its own thread for efficient parallel processing.
- **Custom Callbacks**: Provide your own callback functions to process the data as it arrives.
- **Adjustable Fetch Interval**: Control the rate at which data is fetched by specifying the interval.

### Usage

#### Import and Initialize

```python
from flightmatrix.bridge import FlightMatrixBridge
from flightmatrix.utilities import DataStreamer

# Initialize the FlightMatrixBridge
bridge = FlightMatrixBridge()

# Initialize the DataStreamer
streamer = DataStreamer(bridge)
```

#### Subscribe to Data Streams

```python

import cv2

# Define a callback function for left frame data
def left_frame_callback(frame_data):
    frame = frame_data['frame']
    timestamp = frame_data['timestamp']
    cv2.imshow("Left Frame", frame)
    print("Left Frame Timestamp:", timestamp)

# Subscribe to the left frame data stream
streamer.subscribe("left_frame", left_frame_callback)

# Define a callback function for sensor data
def sensor_data_callback(sensor_data):
    print("Sensor Data:", sensor_data)

# Subscribe to the sensor data stream
streamer.subscribe("sensor_data", sensor_data_callback)
```

### Available Data Streams

- **left_frame**: Left visual frame data.
- **right_frame**: Right visual frame data.
- **left_zdepth**: Left z-depth frame data.
- **right_zdepth**: Right z-depth frame data.
- **left_seg**: Left segmentation frame data.
- **right_seg**: Right segmentation frame data.
- **sensor_data**: Sensor data from the drone or robot.

Use the `subscribe` method to subscribe to the desired data streams and provide a callback function to process the data as it arrives. The callback function will be called with the data as an argument whenever new data is available. for example, the `left_frame_callback` function will be called with the left frame data whenever a new frame is available.
