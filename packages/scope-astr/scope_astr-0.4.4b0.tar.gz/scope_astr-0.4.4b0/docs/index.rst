scope
==================================
*scope* is a Python package for simulating ground-based, high-resolution, cross-correlation spectroscopy
of exoplanet atmospheres (HRCCS). The goal of this package is to provide a simple way to
simulate HRCCS observations with a simple API.

*scope* is currently under development `on GitHub <https://github.com/arjunsavel/scope>`_ and is ready for beta users. The package currently supports
simulating transmission and emission spectra.
