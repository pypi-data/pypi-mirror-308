# Welcome to NGIO

NGIO is a Python library to streamline OME-Zarr image analysis workflows.

**Main Goals:**

- Abstract object base API for handling OME-Zarr files
- Powefull iterators for processing data using common access patterns
- Tight integration with [Fractal's Table Fractal](https://fractal-analytics-platform.github.io/fractal-tasks-core/tables/)
- Validate OME-Zarr files

To get started, check out the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide.
