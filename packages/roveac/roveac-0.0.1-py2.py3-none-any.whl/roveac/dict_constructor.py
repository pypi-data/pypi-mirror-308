class TriangleConstructor(DictConstructor):

    Constructs a dictionary of subgraphs, hashed by counts of subgraphs of size 3.

    This class extends `DictConstructor` to generate a dictionary of sets, where each key 
    is derived from the triangle-based subgraph count hash. It stores unique subgraphs 
    with isomorphic neighbor mappings to facilitate further graph-based operations.

    Methods
    -------
    construct_dict(r_s_t_n: set, early_stopping=None) -> dict
        Constructs a dictionary from a set of graphs, grouping subgraphs of size `n-1` by 
        unique keys and storing their neighbor mappings.

        """
        Generate a dictionary of subgraphs hashed by triangle counts for isomorphism-based grouping.

        This method iterates over each graph in `r_s_t_n`, removing one node at a time to 
        produce subgraphs of size `n-1`. Each subgraph is hashed using the `TriangleGenerator` 
        key and is checked for isomorphism with existing entries in the dictionary `D`.
        Neighbor mappings are stored for each unique subgraph to support additional operations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        r_s_t_n : set of nx.Graph
            Set of graphs to process into subgraphs of size `n-1`, grouped by isomorphism.
        early_stopping : int, optional

    construct_dict(r_s_t_n: set, early_stopping=None) -> dict
        Constructs a double-keyed dictionary of unique subgraphs with isomorphic neighbor mappings.
    """
    @classmethod
    def construct_dict(cls, r_s_t_n: set, early_stopping=None) -> dict:
        """
        Generates a dictionary with nested hash keys for efficient subgraph isomorphism checks.

        This function iterates over combinations of nodes in each graph in `r_s_t_n`,
        producing subgraphs by node removal. Subgraphs are hashed first by primary keys 
        generated by `TriangleGenerator`, then grouped by isomorphic mappings of pairs 
        of subgraphs. The resulting dictionary structure, `D`, enables efficient lookup 
        by double-key hashing.

        Parameters
        ----------
        r_s_t_n : set of nx.Graph
            Set of graphs used for generating the subgraphs with double-key hashing.
        early_stopping : int, optional
            Stops execution early after a set number of iterations.

        Returns
        -------
        tuple
            Returns `D` with all isomorphic mappings and `reduced_D`, a subset of `D` 
            containing one representative per isomorphism group.
