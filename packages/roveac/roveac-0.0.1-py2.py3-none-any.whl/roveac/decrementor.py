class TriangleDecrementor(Decrementor):
    """
    Performs decrementing operations on sets of graphs for Ramsey theory computations,
    specifically aimed at reducing graphs by removing nodes to check for specific properties.

    This class extends `Decrementor` to implement a specialized decrementing method that 
    operates on sets of graphs, utilizing a unique key-based storage mechanism for subgraphs.

    Methods
    -------
    decrement(r_s_t_n: set, early_stopping=None) -> dict
        Decrements each graph in `r_s_t_n` by removing individual nodes, generating subgraphs,
        and indexing them based on unique keys.
    """

    @classmethod
    def decrement(cls, r_s_t_n: set, early_stopping=None) -> dict:
        """
        Decrement each graph in `r_s_t_n` by removing nodes and indexing resulting subgraphs.

        For each graph in `r_s_t_n`, iteratively removes nodes to create subgraphs, which 
        are stored in a dictionary `D` keyed by a unique identifier. If a subgraph is already 
        present in `D`, isomorphism checks are performed to ensure unique storage of isomorphic 
        subgraphs. The function halts early if the `early_stopping` limit is reached.

        Parameters
        ----------
        r_s_t_n : set of nx.Graph
            Set of graphs on which decrementing operations are performed.
        early_stopping : int, optional
            Limits the total number of decrementing iterations, halting early if reached.

        Returns
        -------
        set of nx.Graph
            Set of all unique subgraphs created through the decrementing process, with node
            labels converted to integers.
