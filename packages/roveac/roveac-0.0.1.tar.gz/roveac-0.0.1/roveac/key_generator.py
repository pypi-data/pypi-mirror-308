====================

This module provides the `KeyGenerator` abstract base class, which defines a method
for generating a key from a graph for use in dictionary generation and hashing.

Classes
-------
KeyGenerator : ABC
    Abstract base class for generating keys from graphs.
TriangleGenerator : KeyGenerator
    Generates key for number of triangles through each vertex.
Sub3Generator : KeyGenerator
    Generates key for all subgraphs of size 3 through each vertex.

    @classmethod
    def generate_key(cls, G):
        """
        Generate a unique key for the provided graph `G`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : Graph
            The graph from which to generate the key.

class TriangleGenerator(KeyGenerator):
    """
    Generates a unique key based on triangle counts for each node in a graph.

    This class extends `KeyGenerator` to provide a method that creates a key 
    representing the distribution of triangles in the graph, facilitating graph 
    comparisons in applications where triangle structures are relevant.

    Methods
    -------
    generate_key(G: nx.Graph) -> tuple
        Generates a sorted tuple key based on the triangle counts for nodes in `G`.

        """
        Generate a unique key for the graph `G` based on the count of triangles at each node.

        This method computes the triangle counts for all nodes in `G` and returns a sorted
        tuple of these counts in descending order. The resulting key can be used to identify
        or compare graphs with similar triangle structures.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : nx.Graph
            The graph for which the key is generated, based on triangle counts.

        tuple of int
            A sorted tuple of triangle counts in descending order, representing the triangle
            structure of `G`.
