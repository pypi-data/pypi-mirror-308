## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3**: The script is written in Python and requires Python 3 to run.
- **libnotify-bin**: Enables desktop notifications on Linux systems.
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**: Allows the script to interact with GitHub.

**Install required packages on Debian/Ubuntu:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 libnotify-bin gh
```

2. **Clone the Repository**: Download the script by cloning the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bytexenon/Github-Desktop-Notifier
cd Github-Desktop-Notifier
```

## Usage

Using GitHub Desktop Notifier is straightforward. Follow these steps to start receiving notifications:

1. **Run the Script**: Start the script to begin receiving notifications.

```bash
python src/__main__.py
```

- If you haven't authenticated with `gh` (GitHub CLI), you'll be prompted to do so. Follow the instructions to authenticate via your web browser.
- After authenticating, the script will run in the background and send you desktop notifications for new GitHub activities.

**That's it!** You'll now receive desktop notifications for new GitHub activities. Click on the notification buttons to open the notification in your browser or mark it as read.
