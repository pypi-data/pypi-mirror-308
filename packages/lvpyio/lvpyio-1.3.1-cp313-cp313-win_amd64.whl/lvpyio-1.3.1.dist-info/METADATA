# Difference between Lvpyio and Lvpyio_wrapped

There are two packages to choose from: [lvpyio](https://pypi.org/project/lvpyio/)
and [lvpyio_wrapped](https://pypi.org/project/lvpyio_wrapped/). Their interface 
is identical. Most users should use `lvpyio`. Users who wish to use Qt 5 and
`lvpyio` in the same Python process might need `lvpyio_wrapped`. See the
documentation referenced above for details.

# Miscellaneous

Before version 1.3.0, `lvpyio` was called `lvreader`.

# Feedback
