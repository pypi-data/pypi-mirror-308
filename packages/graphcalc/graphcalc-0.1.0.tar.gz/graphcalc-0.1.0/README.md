# graphcalc

## Overview

`graphcalc` is a Python package for performing a variety of graph computations, including maximum clique detection, chromatic number calculation, and vertex cover identification. It is built on top of `networkx` and provides efficient implementations of fundamental graph theory algorithms.

## Features

- **Maximum Clique**: Finds the maximum clique in a given graph.
- **Chromatic Number**: Computes the minimum number of colors required for graph coloring.
- **Vertex and Edge Cover**: Determines vertex and edge covers.
- **Matching and Independence**: Calculates maximum matching and independent sets.

## Installation

To install `graphcalc`, make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher, then install it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graphcomp.git
cd graphcomp
pip install -e .
```
