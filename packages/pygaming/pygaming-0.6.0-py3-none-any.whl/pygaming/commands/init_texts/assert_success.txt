The folder 'assets' has been created. It will be used to store all the assets of the game:
musics, sounds, fonts and images

The folder contains several subfolders and files:
----
The default icon is pygaming's icon, rememeber to replace this file with your own icon.
To create a .icon file, use the image software you want (e.g : microsoft paint) to create your own icon,
then convert into an .ico file (you can use online converters) and be sure to name it 'icon.ico'.
----
The musics, sounds, fonts and images folders will be used by you to store the different assets of the game.
You can load them by using the FontFile, MusicFile, SoundFile and ImageFile to load them in the game.
----
The musics folder contains an empty file: loop_times.json, this file must be filled with a dictionnary-like content with:
- The keys are the name of the music file (e.g : "music.mp3")
- The values are the instants (in second) on which you want the musics to loop when finished
    (e.g: 13.458, when the menu music ends, it restart at 13.458 seconds from the start)
This file can stay empty if you don't have any music you want to loop.
----
The sounds folder contains an empty file: categories.json, this must be fille with a dictionnary-like content with:
- The keys are the name of the sound file (e.g : "rain.ogg")
- The values are the categories of the sounds (e.g : "ambient"). The categories are used to manage the volume of the sounds.
