    "## Types of Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata in Pickaxe-Generic is information associated with a molecule, operator, or reaction (here referenced as \"data objects\").  Despite such a general definition, we can still outline some classifications of metadata which may be calculated \"on-the-fly\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The first way to classify metadata is based on its \"purity\" by separating metadata into *inherent* and *contextual* categories.  These categories are related to the concept of a [pure function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function).  For a given data object, metadata which is always the same for that object, regardless of context, is termed *inherent* metadata.  By contrast, *contextual* metadata relies on the data object's context within the network, and therefore might change during a given network expansion.  Some examples of each of these types are given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inherent Metadata\n",
    "  * Gas-phase enthalpy of formation at 298 K\n",
    "  * Gas-phase entropy of formation at 298 K\n",
    "  * Molecular formula\n",
    "  * Molecular fingerprint\n",
    "  * Tanimoto similarity of molecule to target\n",
    "  * Toxicity of molecule\n",
    "  * Name of operator\n",
    "  * Gas-phase enthalpy of reaction at 298 K\n",
    "  * Gas-phase Gibbs free energy of reaction at 298 K\n",
    "* Contextual Metadata\n",
    "  * Maximum atom economy to produce molecule from particular reagents, assuming side products are discarded\n",
    "  * Minimum cost to produce molecule from particular reagents, assuming side products are discarded\n",
    "  * Net flux of molecule (for microkinetic models)\n",
    "\n",
    "The inherent vs. contextual metadata classification is most useful when deciding how it ought to be calculated.  However, there is another classification which is more useful when determining if metadata calculation may be achieved in parallel during network expansion (the most efficient place for it).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way to classify metadata is by separating it based on the information necessary to calculate it.  Metadata which requires only the information contained in a single reaction to calculate (plus some way to resolve between different values) is termed *local* metadata.  Metadata which requires more information, typically about the network as a whole, is termed *global* metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "All *inherent* metadata is *local*, since it can be calculated easily requiring not just a single reaction, but a single data object.  However, some of the previously defined *contextual* metadata may be calculated locally.  One example is maximum atom economy (to produce a particular molecule from particular reagents which are not necessarily its immediate precursors).  If the maximum atom economy to produce each reactant is known, then the atom economy of the products of a reaction may be calculated using only that information and the reaction's stoichiometry.  If two reactions both produce the same molecule, but different atom economy values for that molecule, then clearly the maximum between those two is the correct one.  Because a value may be calculated from an individual reaction, and there exists a function to consistently resolve conflicts between that value and others which are calculated, maximum atom economy is *local* metadata.  However, net flux for batch reactors is based on the state of the entire microkinetic network, and so cannot be calculated locally.  In fact, depending on the model used the net flux may change regularly for all molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model of *local* vs. *global* metadata may seem complex, but is required in order to determine which values may be calculated during network generation, instead of being globally updated between network generation steps.  Only *local* metadata may be calculated during network generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Developer's Note\n",
    "\n",
    "You may realize that inherent metadata does not necessarily have to be stored as metadata, since it can be recalculated given only the data object.  While this is technically true, having to recalculate complex inherent metadata may take more time than simply using the metadata framework as a cache for this information.  In addition, Pickaxe-Generic will not pass the data object to Recipe enumeration processes if only the metadata will suffice for the recipe filters and recipe ranking functions.  This saves on I/O, which is often the bottleneck of parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inherent Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "Inherent metadata can be calculated directly from a data object.  One example is the molecular weight of a molecule.  Below is an example where the molecular weight of relevant molecules is calculated during network expansion."

For example, the \"generation\" of a molecule can be defined as an integer, where in a particular reaction the generation of a product molecule is the largest generation of any reactant plus one, and in a larger sense is the smallest generation calculated from all the reactions which produce that molecule.  Since this is a recursive definition, some molecules must have their generation defined before runtime.  Reagents often have their generation value set to 0.\n",

    "\n",
    "## The Reaction Analysis Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation and organization of metadata calculation is done in two possible places: either when new molecules are produced from a reaction, or during a global update phase in between network expansion iterations.  The global update phase will be covered later, in the \"Global Metadata\" section and again in more depth in its own dedicated tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a reaction produces molecules (which can be done in parallel), there may be several metadata components which the user wishes to calculate.  The classes which determine how these metadata are calculated are called *calculators*.  Some of these calculators may depend on the values of other metadata, and thus a particular ordering of calculation is required.  Combining several metadata calculators into a metadata calculation scheme produces a `Reaction Analysis Plan`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of a reaction analysis plan.  There are three values we would like to calculate: first, the molecule generation.  This will help us understand when each molecule is created.  Second, the molecular weight of each molecule.  Third, the mass waste of creating each molecule.  The mass waste for a particular reaction product is calculated by summing the current mass waste of the reactants with the total molecular masses of the other reaction products.  The mass waste for a molecule in the context of the entire reaction network is the minimum possible value of this number, taking all evaluated reactions into consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the mass waste requires knowledge of the molecular weight of each molecule involved in the reaction.  We could calculate this number for every molecule every time a reaction is evaluated, but using metadata is possibly more efficient due to requiring fewer function calls (at least on a single processor; the I/O overhead in a multiprocessing environment may require stricter means).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the mass waste calculation depends on knowing the molecular weight of product species, it must be calculated AFTER the molecular weight of products.  The example below demonstrates the use of a reaction analysis plan which implements this approach.  As in the generation case, the waste metadata must be initialized for reagents."
