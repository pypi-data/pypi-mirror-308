    "Now we have two different products.  What's going on?\n",

    "The answer is because, when matching the first template to butanone, RDKit has a choice of two different carbons for atom 3.  In acetone, these carbon atoms are symmetric in the molecule, so the choice doesn't make a difference.  In butanone, however, one of them is tertiary and the other is a secondary carbon.  Therefore, the product sets are different based on which carbon was picked to match the template.\n",

However, if degenerate template matches are of interest to you, there are opportunities to consider this information during a network expansion.  This will be discussed later in the metadata section.\n",

    "Operators in Pickaxe-Generic have an additional function, which is used to test the compatibility of a molecule with a particular argument of an operator.  This allows the program to cache which molecules can be used with which operators, and with which arguments.  Doing this often speeds up network expansion tremendously, so if you are trying to implement a new type of operator, be sure to keep this in mind.  Side note: this functionality is also useful for testing out new SMARTS reaction strings.\n",
