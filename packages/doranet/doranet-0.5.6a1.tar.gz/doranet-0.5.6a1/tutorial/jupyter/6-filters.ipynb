    "### Reaction Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Reaction filters are the most powerful of all filter types in terms of both speed and memory, but come with a number of warnings and caveats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reaction filters are capable of preventing new molecules from even entering the pool of consideration via the `reactive` flag functionality provided by the network, while still allowing those molecules to be stored in the network.  They can also be paired with metadata calculators for maximum efficiency (see the [next section](./7-metadata.ipynb)).  This is by far the most effective and fast method of accelerating network expansion, but it affects some non-obvious components of the network:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It will not prevent molecules which are already in the network and flagged as `reactive=True` from reacting.  A particular network is not permitted to change the `reactive` flag from `True` to `False` at any time.  Thus, when starting with a network which has molecules you do not want to react which are flagged `reactive=True`, a ReactionFilter will do nothing to change this.  General recommendations are to use a blacklisting MolFilter to block the specific indices of those molecules from reacting or to create a new network in case of performance issues.  This is an unfortunate limitation of the chemical network interface (which is intended to guarantee consistency for computational efficiency reasons), and is generally unavoidable.\n",
    "    * In the future, a network type `subnetwork` will be implemented which allows a subset of a primary network to be interacted with.  This will mitigate the potential performance issues of the workaround above, so that networks which exist on an external data source can be used for expansion without loading all molecules in the network.\n",
    "* Once used, molecules flagged `reactive=False` will not be reacted when using different strategies, even though they are present in the network.  If this is not to your liking, you can use the `add_mol()` function to set the `reactive` flag to `True`.  Keep in mind that this operation is not reversible.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example where a reaction filter is efficient is in preventing certain reactions which produce very large molecules.  This helps to 1. stem polymerization and 2. reduce the number of functional groups per molecule.  Another application may be to prevent reactions which have a very large enthalpy of reaction, or which have products which are unrealistic or low in yield.\n",

    "#### Developer Note\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that the argument for entering a reaction filter into `.expand()` is in fact `reaction_plan`, not `reaction_filter` as would follow the pattern of the other filter types.  This is because reaction filters are much more internally complex than the pre-reaction filters, and are actually part of [an extended metadata calculation framework](./7-metadata.ipynb) which enables the most powerful features of Pickaxe-Generic, including the parallel calculation, optimization, and caching of critical molecule properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Filter Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the additional powerful features of Pickaxe-Generic is that it uses extensive [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition).\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the built-in filters, or even designing your own, you may wonder \"but what if I want an exception to this molecule filter for this specific operator\" or \"if only I was able to use both of these bundle filters.\"  Your immediate reaction may to go straight to the code and create your own filter type which implements all the required functions, etc.  However, if the basic filters you want already exist, and the statement you would like to filter for can be expressed in terms of the basic logical operators AND, OR, XOR, and NOT, then you don't have to write any additional classes or function!  Note: this advertisement does not apply to the bundle filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply use the syntax `filter12 = filter1 & filter2` to create a new `filter12` which for an argument `x` tests the assertion `filter1(x) and filter2(x)`.  These compounds can also be nested using parentheses: `filter12or3 = (filter1 & filter2) | filter3` tests the same assertion as previous, but also passes those assertions which pass `filter3`.  The list of logical operators and their corresponding Python operators is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical Operator | Python Operator\n",
    "---|---\n",
    "AND | &\n",
    "OR | \\|\n",
    "XOR | ^\n",
    "NOT | -\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations are also implemented using short-circuiting, so make sure to order your filters such that the solution can be computed as quickly as possible!\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the bundle filter doesn't work quite like the others in terms of its return value, you can't use these logical operators with it.  However, you can chain multiple bundle filters using `>>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "🚧🚧Example of filter composition coming soon.🚧🚧\n",
    "\n",
    "## Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are four varieties of filter: molecule filters, bundle filters, recipe filters, and reaction filters.\n",
    "    1. Molecule filters test specific molecules and remove them from the reaction lists.\n",
    "    1. Bundle filters limit the types of combinations which can occur to produce recipes.\n",
    "    1. Recipe filters stop individual reactions from occurring.  They are fairly inefficient, but some applications require them.\n",
    "    1. Reaction filters do not stop reactions which have already occurred.  Instead, they prevent the products of some reactions from being further reacted via the `reactive=False` flag.\n",
    "1. Molecule, Recipe, and Reaction filters can be composed with logical operators `&`, `|`, `^`, and `-`.  Bundle filters can be composed using `>>`.\n",
    "\n",
