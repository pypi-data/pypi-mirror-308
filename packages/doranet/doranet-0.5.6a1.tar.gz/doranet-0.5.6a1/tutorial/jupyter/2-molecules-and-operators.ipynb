    "Investigating what this molecule consists of shows that the SMILES string appears to be different.  This is because the SMILES string has been \"canonicalized\" by RDKit.  Because there are many SMILES strings which could represent the same molecule, it becomes difficult to quickly compare two molecules to see if they are the same one.  Therefore, RDKit has a procedure such that for a particular molecule, only one of those SMILES strings is considered valid.  This is the \"canonical\" SMILES string."

However, depending on your application this may be something more complex."

    "\n",
    "1. The Engine contains configuration information and can initialize most objects in Pickaxe-Generic.\n",
    "2. Molecules obtained via `engine.mol.rdkit` wrap an RDKit-style molecule using Daylight SMILES syntax.\n",
    "3. Operators obtained via `engine.op.rdkit` wrap an RDKit-style template-based operator using Daylight Reaction SMARTS syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations!  You have finished the second part of the Pickaxe-Generic tutorial.  Proceed to the [next part](./3-writing-operators.ipynb) to learn some nuances of writing operators in the RDKit style."
