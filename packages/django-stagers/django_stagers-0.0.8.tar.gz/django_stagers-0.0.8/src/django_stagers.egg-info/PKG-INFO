# Django Stagers
This package provides a class `Stager` to stage model instances for bulk creation, update, or deletion at a later time. That way, you can focus on writing sync logic without worrying about keeping track of model instances or their unique identifiers.

# Installation

Install using `pip`:
```bash
pip install django-stagers
```

Import the `Stager` class:
```python
from django_stagers import Stager
```

# Usage
Instantiate a `Stager` class (optionally with a type for better type-hinting) and then call the `create()` function to add models. When any of the three staging methods `create()`, `delete()` or `update()` are called, though, the corresponding action is not actually taken in the database until the user calls `commit()`, at which point all of the staged actions are run in bulk fashion.

```python
from django_stagers import Stager

foo_stager = Stager[Foo](queryset=Foo.objects.all(), key="id")

foo_stager.create(Foo(attr="abc"))
foo_stager.create(Foo(attr="def"))
...

foo_stager.commit()
```

The output of the operation will look something like this:
```
Sat Nov 2 2024 2:36:37 PM [INFO    ]: Committing staged Foo instances.
Sat Nov 2 2024 2:36:37 PM [INFO    ]: Created     37 Foo instances.
```

## Access Existing Instances
Another key feature of stagers is that they keep track of existing model instances in the database using the `existing` attribute. This way, it is easy to check whether a new object is already tracked in the django database or has already been staged previously. 

```python

for serialized_foo in serialized_foos:
  if existing_foo := foo_stager.existing.get(serialized_foo['key']):
    foo_stager.update(serialized_foo['key'], 'attr', serialized_foo['attr'])
  else:
    foo_stager.create(Foo(**serialized_foo))
...

foo_stager.commit()
```
