Install PyVarTools using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install PyVarTools


Usage Examples
---------------

The following examples illustrate a small subset of PyVarTools’ capabilities.  Refer to the detailed documentation for more comprehensive examples and usage instructions.

**Formatting pandas.DataFrame:**

.. code-block:: python

    # Formatting
    from PyVarTools.format_tools import format_data_frame
    import pandas as pd

    df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2.5, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})
    formatted_df = format_data_frame(df)
    print(formatted_df)

**Yielding datetime in range:**

.. code-block:: python

    # Date Manipulation
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    from PyVarTools.var_utilities import date_range

    start = datetime(2024, 1, 1)
    end = datetime(2024, 1, 5)
    delta = timedelta(days=1)

    for date in date_range(start, end, delta):
        print(date)
