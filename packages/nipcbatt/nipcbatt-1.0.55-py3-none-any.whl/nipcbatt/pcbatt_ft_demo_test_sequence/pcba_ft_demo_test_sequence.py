"""
PCBA FT Demo Test Sequences demonstrates testing of PCBA DUTs using PCIe DAQ and TestScale Hardware. 
These example sequences can be executed in hardware simulation using the Python pcbatt 
measurement libraries and can be built off of for a custom sequencer.

Limits suggested will return a FAIL test with DAQ simulation and they need to be changed 
to match your physical hardware.
