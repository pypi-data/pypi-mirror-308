## Installation

```bash
$ pip install psychopy_bids
```

## Usage

`psychopy_bids` can be used to create valid BIDS datasets by adding the possibility of using [task events](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04-modality-specific-files/05-task-events.html) in PsychoPy.

```python
from psychopy_bids import bids

handler = bids.BIDSHandler(dataset="example", subject="01", task="A")
handler.createDataset()

event_list = [bids.BIDSTaskEvent(onset=1.0, duration=0, trial_type="trigger")]
participant_info = {"participant_id": handler.subject, "age": 18}

handler.addTaskEvents(event_list, participant_info)
```
