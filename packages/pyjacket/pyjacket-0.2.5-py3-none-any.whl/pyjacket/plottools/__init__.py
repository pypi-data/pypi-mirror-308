"""What do I want


Units are annoying


Plotting is annoying because:
- there is always multiple ways to do the same thing
- i always need to change the default style in the same way

== Scatters (defaults as plot)==
fig, ax = subplots(2, 2)   #2x2 frame


# Figure properties:
 - ax spacing
 - size
 
# Ax properties
- axes
- title
- labels

# data-entry properties
 - line width, pattern
 - marker type


import plottools as plt

plt.set_style('sprakel')

ax[0, 0].plot()
 => get a nice plot in the information style
