# Custom Neural Network Library

This repository is a mini-library that implements a simple version of a fully connected neural network (FCNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch using Python and PyTorch. PyTorch is used solely for mathematical and element-wise operations on tensors (without using autograd), and for speeding up computations by utilizing the GPU. Simply put, PyTorch is used as a replacement for NumPy but with GPU acceleration. The library provides basic functionalities for building, training, and evaluating custom neural network models for both regression and classification tasks. Practical examples of applying the library for creating neural networks for regression and classification using datasets like Iris, MNIST and synthetic datasets can be found in the **notebooks/** folder.

## Features

- **Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)**: A fully connected neural network suitable for regression and classification tasks.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A simplified CNN implementation with convolutional and max-pooling layers.
- **Activation Functions**: Includes ReLU, Leaky ReLU, Sigmoid, and Linear activations.
- **Loss Functions**: Support for mean squared error (MSE), binary cross-entropy (BCE) and categorical cross-entropy (CCE) losses.
- **Optimizers**: Implementations of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Adam optimizers.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy metric for classification tasks, especially useful for one-hot encoded data, and R2 score for regression tasks.

## Installation

## Usage

### Data Format examples:
#### Example for regression:
```
# sample shape (2, 1) - 2 input values, 1 output value
dataset = [
    {
        "input": [0.1, 0.2],
        "output": [0.15],
    },
    {
        "input": [0.8, 0.9],
        "output": [0.7],
    },
]
```
#### Example for classification, output values one-hot encoded:
```
# sample shape (4, 2) - 4 input values, 2 output one-hot encoded values
dataset = [
    {
        "input": [0.13, 0.22, 0.37, 0.41],
        "output": [1.0, 0.0],
    },
    {
        "input": [0.76, 0.87, 0.91, 0.93],
        "output": [0.0, 1.0],
    },
]
```
