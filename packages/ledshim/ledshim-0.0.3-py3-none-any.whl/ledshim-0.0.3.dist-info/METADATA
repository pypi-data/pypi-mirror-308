28 tiny RGB LED pixels in a single row that just slip right onto your Pi's pins, no soldering required! LED SHIM is ideal for status updates, notifications, a VU meter, or as a bar graph for sensor readings.

## Installing

### Full install (recommended):

We've created an easy installation script that will install all pre-requisites and get your LED SHIM
up and running with minimal efforts. To run it, fire up Terminal which you'll find in Menu -> Accessories -> Terminal on your Raspberry Pi desktop, as illustrated below:

![Finding the terminal](http://get.pimoroni.com/resources/github-repo-terminal.png)

In the new terminal window type the command exactly as it appears below (check for typos) and follow the on-screen instructions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/led-shim
cd led-shim
./install.sh
```

### Development:

If you want to contribute, or like living on the edge of your seat by having the latest code, you should clone this repository, `cd` to the library directory, and run:

```bash
./install.sh --unstable
```

In all cases you will have to enable the i2c bus:

```
sudo raspi-config nonint do_i2c 0
```
