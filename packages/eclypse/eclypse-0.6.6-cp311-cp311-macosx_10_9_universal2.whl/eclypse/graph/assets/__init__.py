"""Package for defining asset classes. Available classes are:

- `Asset`: The base and extendable class for all assets.
- `Additive`: Represents a numeric asset where the aggregation is additive.
- `Multiplicative`: Represents a numeric asset where the aggregation is multiplicative.
- `Concave`: Represents a numeric asset where the aggregation is concave.
- `Convex`: Represents a numeric asset where the aggregation is convex.
- `Symbolic`: Represents a symbolic asset (set of values with no order relation).
- `AssetBucket`: Represents a collection of assets.
