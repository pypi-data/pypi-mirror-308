Uploading to PyPi works automatically when merging to the github main-branch.
Install it via pip in your conda environemnt. It is currently not uploaded to conda-forge, so
it cannot be found in conda.

Be sure to update the version both in __init__.py and pyproject.toml before merging to main!

COL vs ROW Convention:

In ROOT its (col, row), but:
data is represented as (frame,row,nreps,col), so i will use (row, col) here, since its the
natural order in the array.
