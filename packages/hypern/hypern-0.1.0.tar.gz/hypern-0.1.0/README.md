```

## ü§î Usage

### üèÉ Run your code

This using default CLI Robyn, you can see bellow. You will then have access to a server on the `localhost:5005`,
```python
# main.py
from hypern import Hypern
from hypern.routing import Route, HTTPEndpoint

class MyEndpoint(HTTPEndpoint):
    
    async def get(self, global_dependencies):
        return {"data": "Hello World"}

routing = [
    Route("/hello", MyEndpoint)
]

app = Hypern(routing)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.start(host='localhost', port=5005)
```

```
$ python3 main.py
```

To see the usage

```
usage: main.py [-h] [--processes PROCESSES] [--workers WORKERS] [--dev] [--log-level LOG_LEVEL]

options:
  -h, --help                show this help message and exit
  --processes PROCESSES     Choose the number of processes. [Default: 1]
  --workers WORKERS         Choose the number of workers. [Default: 1]
  --dev                     Development mode. It restarts the server based on file changes.
  --log-level LOG_LEVEL     Set the log level name
  --create                  Create a new project template.
  --docs                    Open the Robyn documentation.
  --open-browser            Open the browser on successful start.
```

Log level can be `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, or `ERROR`.
