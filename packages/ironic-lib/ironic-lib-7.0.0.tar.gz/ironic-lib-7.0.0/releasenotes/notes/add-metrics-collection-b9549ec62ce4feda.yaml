    Adds a new metrics collection backend, ``collector``, to collect
    counter, gauge, and timer information, enabling the applicationg to
    access these statistics during process runtime. Adds a new metrics method
    ``get_metrics_data`` to allow the dictionary structure containing
    the metrics data to be accessed. This feature may be enabled by setting
    the ``[metrics]\backend`` option to ``collector``.
