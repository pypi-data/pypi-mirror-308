    The default size of EFI system partitions to be created, when writing a
    partition image, has been increased to 550 Megabytes from 200 Megabytes.
    If this change is undesirable, please utilize the
    ``efi_system_partition_size`` configuration option. This value is now
    also consistent with the internal default when creating ESP volumes
    for Software RAID with ``ironic-python-agent``, and the default carried
    by ``diskimage-builder``. The prime driver for an increased partition
    size is to enable OS driven firmware updates and appropriate space to
    house Unikernels which requires additional space.
