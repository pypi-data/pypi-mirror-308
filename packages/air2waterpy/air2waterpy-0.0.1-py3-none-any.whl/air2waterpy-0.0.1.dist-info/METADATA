**air2waterpy** is a Python package implementing the air2water model (Piccolroaz et al., 2013), a lump model for simulating lake surface water temperature (LSWT) based on air temperature. The original air2water model is written in Fortran, [link to the repo](https://github.com/marcotoffolon/air2water). In this pacakge, we rewrote the model code with [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) which can allow users who are more familar with python to implement an air2water model in few lines of code. The code structure is adapted from the Rainfall-Runoff modelling playground ([RRMPG](https://github.com/kratzert/RRMPG)).
