    Bare-bone block that serves as a data interface for the 'Subsystem' class.

    It works like this:
    - Internal blocks of the subsystem are connected to the inputs and outputs 
      of this Interface block via the internal connections.
    - It behaves like a normal block (inherits the main 'Block' class methods).
    - It implements some special methods to get and set the inputs and outputs 
      of the blocks, that are used to translate between the internal blocks of the 
      subsystem and the inputs and outputs of the subsystem.
    - Handles data transfer to and from the internal subsystem blocks 
      to and from the inputs and outputs of the subsystem.

# MAIN SUBSYSTEM CLASS ==================================================================

class Subsystem(Block):
    """
    Subsystem class that holds its own blocks and connecions and 
    can natively interface with the main simulation loop. 

    IO interface is realized by a special 'Interface' block, that has extra 
    methods for setting and getting inputs and outputs and serves 
    as the interface of the internal blocks to the outside. 

    The subsystem doesnt use its 'inputs' and 'outputs' dicts directly. 
    It exclusively handles data transfer via the 'Interface' block. 

    This class can be used just like any other block during the simulation, 
    since it implements the required methods 'update' for the fixed-point 
    iteration (resolving algebraic loops with instant time blocks), 
    the 'step' method that performs timestepping (especially for dynamic 
    blocks with internal states) and the 'solve' method for solving the 
    implicit update equation for implicit solvers.
