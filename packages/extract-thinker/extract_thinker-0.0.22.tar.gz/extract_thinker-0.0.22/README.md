# ExtractThinker

Library to extract data from files and documents agnostically using LLMs. `extract_thinker` provides ORM-style interaction between files and LLMs, allowing for flexible and powerful document extraction workflows.

## Features

- Supports multiple document loaders including Tesseract OCR, Azure Form Recognizer, AWS TextExtract, Google Document AI.
- Customizable extraction using contract definitions.
- Asynchronous processing for efficient document handling.
- Built-in support for various document formats.
- ORM-style interaction between files and LLMs.

## Installation

To install `extract_thinker`, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install extract_thinker
```

## Usage
Here's a quick example to get you started with extract_thinker. This example demonstrates how to load a document using Tesseract OCR and extract specific fields defined in a contract.

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from extract_thinker import DocumentLoaderTesseract, Extractor, Contract

load_dotenv()
cwd = os.getcwd()

class InvoiceContract(Contract):
    invoice_number: str
    invoice_date: str

tesseract_path = os.getenv("TESSERACT_PATH")
test_file_path = os.path.join(cwd, "test_images", "invoice.png")

extractor = Extractor()
extractor.load_document_loader(
    DocumentLoaderTesseract(tesseract_path)
)
extractor.load_llm("claude-3-haiku-20240307")

result = extractor.extract(test_file_path, InvoiceContract)

print("Invoice Number: ", result.invoice_number)
print("Invoice Date: ", result.invoice_date)
```

## Splitting Files Example
You can also split and process documents using extract_thinker. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from extract_thinker import DocumentLoaderTesseract, Extractor, Process, Classification, ImageSplitter

load_dotenv()

class DriverLicense(Contract):
    # Define your DriverLicense contract fields here
    pass

class InvoiceContract(Contract):
    invoice_number: str
    invoice_date: str

extractor = Extractor()
extractor.load_document_loader(DocumentLoaderTesseract(os.getenv("TESSERACT_PATH")))
extractor.load_llm("gpt-3.5-turbo")

classifications = [
    Classification(name="Driver License", description="This is a driver license", contract=DriverLicense, extractor=extractor),
    Classification(name="Invoice", description="This is an invoice", contract=InvoiceContract, extractor=extractor)
]

process = Process()
process.load_document_loader(DocumentLoaderTesseract(os.getenv("TESSERACT_PATH")))
process.load_splitter(ImageSplitter())

path = "..."

split_content = process.load_file(path)\
    .split(classifications)\
    .extract()

# Process the split_content as needed
```

## Infrastructure

The `extract_thinker` project is inspired by the LangChain ecosystem, featuring a modular infrastructure with templates, components, and core functions to facilitate robust document extraction and processing.

## Why Just Not LangChain?
While LangChain is a generalized framework designed for a wide array of use cases, extract_thinker is specifically focused on Intelligent Document Processing (IDP). Although achieving 100% accuracy in IDP remains a challenge, leveraging LLMs brings us significantly closer to this goal.
