# CLORPS

**CLORPS** is a Python package for calculating image similarity based on three complementary techniques: **CLIP embeddings**, **LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity)**, and **ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)**. It provides a combined similarity score for one image compared to another image or a set of target images. Ideal for image retrieval, similarity-based ranking, and image comparison tasks.

## Features

- **CLIP Embeddings**: Uses OpenAIâ€™s CLIP model for embedding-based similarity.
- **LPIPS Similarity**: Calculates perceptual similarity using LPIPS.
- **ORB Keypoint Matching**: Traditional ORB-based similarity for structural comparison.
- **Combined Score**: Normalizes and combines the three scores for a final similarity metric.

## Installation

```bash
pip install clorps
```
**Usage**
```bash
from clorps import CLORPS

# Initialize CLORPS instance
clorps_instance = CLORPS()

# Paths to input and target images
input_image_path = "/path/to/input/image.jpg"
target_image_paths = ["/path/to/target/image1.jpg", "/path/to/target/image2.jpg"]

# Calculate combined similarity scores
combined_scores = clorps_instance.calculate_combined_similarity(input_image_path, target_image_paths)
print("Combined similarity scores:", combined_scores)
```
**Input:** Path to the input image and either a single target image path or a list of target image paths.
**Output:** A list of similarity scores, one for each target image.
