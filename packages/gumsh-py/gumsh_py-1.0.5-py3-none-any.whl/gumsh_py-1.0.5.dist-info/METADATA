# gumsh-py
gumsh-py is a Python interface of charm.sh's shell tool called [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum). Gum is used to create aesthetically pleasing shell scripts. 

# Installation
Install gum for your environment using the [instructions](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum).
Then install my python package like so:
```sh
$ pip install gumsh-py
```

# Usage
```python
import gumsh-py


```

# Note
Not all command flag options in the gum library are given for each command. And not all commands are included. If this package picks up steam, I will consider adding support.
E.g. `gum choose` for example allows for a limit which I have included functionality for, but there are other [options](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum/blob/main/choose/options.go) such as `CursorPrefix` that are not included for simplicity's sake. 

To view flags that the Python package uses, go to the [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) repository, choose the command you are using `choose` for example, and open the `options.go` file to view flag options.
