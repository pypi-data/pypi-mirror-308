# Puremote

puremote is a remote experiment status monitoring software designed based on RESTFUL API. It was originally designed to provide remote monitoring for the Incage project of PsychoUnity, but due to the use of web technology, it can now be used for various experimental design frameworks, such as: PyshoToolBox, PsychoPy or MonkeyLogic, etc.
