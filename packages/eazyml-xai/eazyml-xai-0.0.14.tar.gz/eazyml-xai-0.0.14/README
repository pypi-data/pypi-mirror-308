Developer Guidelines:

Edit cythonize_all_env.py to reflect your environment

[Only if you are on MacOS and running for the first time, run "sudo xcodebuild -license" to accept the license]

python cythonize.py build_ext --inplace

# IMPORTANT: needs to be incremented everytime this script is run to prepare a build for the push
