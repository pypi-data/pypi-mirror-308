  Method uses adapted linear congruential generator with newlib/musl parameters.

  This function has following property -

  This function expects current_hash.shape and data.shape[:-1] to
  match/broadcastable.

  Args:
    current_hash: (shape,)
    data: (shape, tensor_len)
    multiplier: (int) multiplier of linear congruential generator
    increment: (int) increment of linear congruential generator

  Returns:
