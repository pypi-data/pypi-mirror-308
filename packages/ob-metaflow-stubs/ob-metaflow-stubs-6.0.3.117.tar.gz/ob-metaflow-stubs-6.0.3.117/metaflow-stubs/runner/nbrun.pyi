class Runner(object, metaclass=type):
    """
    Metaflow's Runner API that presents a programmatic interface
    to run flows and perform other operations either synchronously or asynchronously.
    The class expects a path to the flow file along with optional arguments
    that match top-level options on the command-line.
    
    This class works as a context manager, calling `cleanup()` to remove
    temporary files at exit.
    
    Example:
    ```python
    with Runner('slowflow.py', pylint=False) as runner:
        result = runner.run(alpha=5, tags=["abc", "def"], max_workers=5)
        print(result.run.finished)
    ```
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    flow_file : str
        Path to the flow file to run
    show_output : bool, default True
        Show the 'stdout' and 'stderr' to the console by default,
        Only applicable for synchronous 'run' and 'resume' functions.
    profile : Optional[str], default None
        Metaflow profile to use to run this run. If not specified, the default
        profile is used (or the one already set using `METAFLOW_PROFILE`)
    env : Optional[Dict], default None
        Additional environment variables to set for the Run. This overrides the
        environment set for this process.
    cwd : Optional[str], default None
        The directory to run the subprocess in; if not specified, the current
        directory is used.
    file_read_timeout : int, default 3600
        The timeout until which we try to read the runner attribute file.
    **kwargs : Any
        Additional arguments that you would pass to `python myflow.py` before
        the `run` command.

    Instantiate this class on the last line of a notebook cell where
    a `flow` is defined. In contrast to `Runner`, this class is not
    meant to be used in a context manager. Instead, use a blocking helper
    function like `nbrun` (which calls `cleanup()` internally) or call
    `cleanup()` explictly when using non-blocking APIs.
