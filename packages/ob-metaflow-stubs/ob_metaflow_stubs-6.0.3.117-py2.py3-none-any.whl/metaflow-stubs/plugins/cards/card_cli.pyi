    """
    A `Task` represents an execution of a `Step`.
    
    It contains all `DataArtifact` objects produced by the task as
    well as metadata related to execution.
    
    Note that the `@retry` decorator may cause multiple attempts of
    the task to be present. Usually you want the latest attempt, which
    is what instantiating a `Task` object returns by default. If
    you need to e.g. retrieve logs from a failed attempt, you can
    explicitly get information about a specific attempt by using the
    following syntax when creating a task:
    
    `Task('flow/run/step/task', attempt=<attempt>)`
    
    where `attempt=0` corresponds to the first attempt etc.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    metadata : List[Metadata]
        List of all metadata events associated with the task.
    metadata_dict : Dict[str, str]
        A condensed version of `metadata`: A dictionary where keys
        are names of metadata events and values the latest corresponding event.
    data : MetaflowData
        Container of all data artifacts produced by this task. Note that this
        call downloads all data locally, so it can be slower than accessing
        artifacts individually. See `MetaflowData` for more information.
    artifacts : MetaflowArtifacts
        Container of `DataArtifact` objects produced by this task.
    successful : bool
        True if the task completed successfully.
    finished : bool
        True if the task completed.
    exception : object
        Exception raised by this task if there was one.
    finished_at : datetime
        Time this task finished.
    runtime_name : str
        Runtime this task was executed on.
    stdout : str
        Standard output for the task execution.
    stderr : str
        Standard error output for the task execution.
    code : MetaflowCode
        Code package for this task (if present). See `MetaflowCode`.
    environment_info : Dict[str, str]
        Information about the execution environment.

        - refresh:
            - Setting this mode will refresh the data update for a card.
            - We support this mode because rendering a full card can be an expensive operation, but shipping tiny data updates can be cheap.
            - Setting this mode will call the `refresh` method of a MetaflowCard.
