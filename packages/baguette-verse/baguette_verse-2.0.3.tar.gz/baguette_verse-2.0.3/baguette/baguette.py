Welcome to the Baguette-Verse!
To use Baguette, you have multiple choices.

If you have some ideas about what is Baguette, you can use the commands:
- baguette.prepare (or just prepare) to store execution reports into BAGUETTE files.
- baguette.bake (or just bake) to bake BAGUETTEs.
- baguette.metalib (or just metalib) to enter the metalib, create and manage MetaGraphs.
- baguette.toast (or just toast) to toast existing BAGUETTEs.
                
You can also use '.bag' files which are executable directly to perform most operations.""")
