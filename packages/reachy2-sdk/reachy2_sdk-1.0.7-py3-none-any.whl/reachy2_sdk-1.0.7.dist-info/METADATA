## Install

Use the following command to install:

```console
$ pip install -e .[dev]
```

The *[dev]* option includes tools for developers.

## Usage

Check out the [examples](src/examples/) folder for jupyter notebooks and example scripts.

## Documentation

Documentation is generated via pdoc, and it's available at [https://pollen-robotics.github.io/reachy2-sdk/reachy2_sdk.html](https://pollen-robotics.github.io/reachy2-sdk/reachy2_sdk.html)


It can be generated locally with:
```console
pdoc reachy2_sdk --output-dir docs --logo "https://pollen-robotics.github.io/reachy2-sdk/pollen_logo.png" --logo-link "https://www.pollen-robotics.com" --docformat google
```

The documentation relies on the provided docstrings with the google style. pydocstyle is used to enforced this style.
```console
pydocstyle src/ --convention google --count
```

## Unit tests

To ensure everything is functioning correctly, run the unit tests. There are two groups of tests: offline and online. Offline tests check internal functions using mock objects. Online tests require a connection to a simulated robot (e.g., in rviz), and the virtual robot should exhibit movement during these tests.

To execute the tests, use pytest with an optional category:

```console
$ pytest [-m offline|online]
```

Note that only **offline tests** are executed by the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, as they don't require a gRPC connection.

### Camera tests

Camera tests have their own marks because it requires the cameras to be plugged to the sdk server 

```console
$ pytest -m cameras
```

## Logs

The SDK relies on the [python logging system](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html). Set the desired debug level to see messages from the SDK.

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
