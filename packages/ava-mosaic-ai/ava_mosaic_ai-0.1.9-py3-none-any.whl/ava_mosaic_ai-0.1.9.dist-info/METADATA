## About Ava-Mosaic-AI

Mosaic is a lightweight Python library that extends the capabilities of the Instructor library for LLM-based tasks. Born out of a personal project to streamline repetitive processes in GenAI development, Mosaic aims to reduce overhead and simplify common operations in LLM/GenAI projects.

### Key Features

- Extends Instructor library functionality
- Simplifies common LLM-based tasks
- Reduces code repetition in GenAI projects
- Lightweight and easy to integrate

## Installation

```bash
pip install ava-mosaic-ai
```

## Quick Start

```python
import ava_mosaic_ai
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Initialize LLM
llm = ava_mosaic_ai.get_llm("openai")

# Define response model
class ResponseModel(BaseModel):
    response: str

# Use Mosaic's simplified interface
response = llm.create_completion(
    response_model=ResponseModel,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke about AI"}],
)
print(response)
```
