# Eikosogram

Inspired by the [R eikosograms library](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eikosograms/vignettes/Introduction.html), I decided to create a similar library for Python, as there is currently no such library. There are only a few simple implementations: [[1]](https://andrewtruong.com/data_visualization), [[2]](https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/spack-repo/blob/b5bd14ed3a34bae3ad4677be09af070f0f544293/packages/r-eikosograms/package.py#L9).

Also, inspired by Bayes' theorem [interactive visualization](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ybbhdvruoj) in Desmos I created my [own](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/81hy17u2bt).
