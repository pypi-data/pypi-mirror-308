## Supported Features
MCT offers a range of powerful features to optimize neural network models for efficient deployment. These supported features include:

### Data Generation [*](https://github.com/sony/model_optimization?tab=readme-ov-file#experimental-features)
MCT provides tools for generating synthetic images based on the statistics stored in a model's batch normalization layers. These generated images are valuable for various compression tasks where image data is required, such as quantization and pruning. 
You can customize data generation configurations to suit your specific needs. [Go to the Data Generation page.](https://github.com/sony/model_optimization/blob/main/model_compression_toolkit/data_generation/README.md)

### Quantization
MCT supports different quantization methods:
* Post-training quantization (PTQ): [Keras API](https://sony.github.io/model_optimization/docs/api/api_docs/methods/keras_post_training_quantization.html), [PyTorch API](https://sony.github.io/model_optimization/docs/api/api_docs/methods/pytorch_post_training_quantization.html)
* Gradient-based post-training quantization (GPTQ): [Keras API](https://sony.github.io/model_optimization/docs/api/api_docs/methods/keras_gradient_post_training_quantization.html), [PyTorch API](https://sony.github.io/model_optimization/docs/api/api_docs/methods/pytorch_gradient_post_training_quantization.html)
* Quantization-aware training (QAT) [*](https://github.com/sony/model_optimization?tab=readme-ov-file#experimental-features)


| Quantization Method                           | Complexity | Computational Cost          |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| PTQ                                           | Low        | Low (order of minutes)      |
| GPTQ (parameters fine-tuning using gradients) | Mild       | Mild (order of 2-3 hours)   |
| QAT                                           | High       | High (order of 12-36 hours) |


In addition, MCT supports different quantization schemes for quantizing weights and activations:

* Power-Of-Two (hardware-friendly quantization [1])
* Symmetric
* Uniform

Main features:
* <ins>Graph optimizations:</ins> Transforming the model to an equivalent (yet, more efficient) model (for example, batch-normalization layer folding to its preceding linear layer).
* <ins>Quantization parameter search:</ins> Different methods can be used to minimize the expected added quantization-noise during thresholds search (by default, we use Mean-Square-Error, but other metrics can be used such as No-Clipping, Mean-Average-Error, and more).
* <ins>Advanced quantization algorithms:</ins> To prevent a performance degradation some algorithms are applied such as: 
  * <ins>Shift negative correction:</ins> Symmetric activation quantization can hurt the model's performance when some layers output both negative and positive activations, but their range is asymmetric. For more details please visit [1].
  * <ins>Outliers filtering:</ins> Computing z-score for activation statistics to detect and remove outliers.
* <ins>Clustering:</ins> Using non-uniform quantization grid to quantize the weights and activations to match their distributions.[*](https://github.com/sony/model_optimization?tab=readme-ov-file#experimental-features)
* <ins>Mixed-precision search:</ins> Assigning quantization bit-width per layer (for weights/activations), based on the layer's sensitivity to different bit-widths.
* <ins>Visualization:</ins> You can use TensorBoard to observe useful information for troubleshooting the quantized model's performance (for example, the model in different phases of the quantization, collected statistics, similarity between layers of the float and quantized model and bit-width configuration for mixed-precision quantization). For more details, please read the [visualization documentation](https://sony.github.io/model_optimization/docs/guidelines/visualization.html).   
* <ins>Target Platform Capabilities:</ins> The Target Platform Capabilities (TPC) describes the target platform (an edge device with dedicated hardware). For more details, please read the [TPC README](https://github.com/sony/model_optimization/blob/main/model_compression_toolkit/target_platform_capabilities/README.md).   

### Enhanced Post-Training Quantization (EPTQ)
As part of the GPTQ we provide an advanced optimization algorithm called EPTQ.

The specifications of the algorithm are detailed in the paper: _"**EPTQ: Enhanced Post-Training Quantization via Label-Free Hessian**"_ [4].

More details on the how to use EPTQ via MCT can be found in the [EPTQ guidelines](https://github.com/sony/model_optimization/blob/main/model_compression_toolkit/gptq/README.md).


### Structured Pruning [*](https://github.com/sony/model_optimization?tab=readme-ov-file#experimental-features)
MCT introduces a structured and hardware-aware model pruning.
This pruning technique is designed to compress models for specific hardware architectures, 
taking into account the target platform's Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) capabilities. 
By pruning groups of channels (SIMD groups), our approach not only reduces model size 
and complexity, but ensures that better utilization of channels is in line with the SIMD architecture 
for a target Resource Utilization of weights memory footprint.

[Pytorch API](https://sony.github.io/model_optimization/docs/api/api_docs/methods/pytorch_pruning_experimental.html) 

#### Experimental features 

Some features are experimental and subject to future changes.
