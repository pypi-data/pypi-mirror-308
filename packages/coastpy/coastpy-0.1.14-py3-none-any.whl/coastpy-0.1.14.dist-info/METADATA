# CoastPy

Python tools for cloud-native coastal analytics.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install coastpy
```

## Usage
More extensive installation and usage instructions will come when we build the 
documentation. For now you can clone the repository, install the environment - that comes
with jupyterlab -, and then launch jupyter lab to explore the tutorials.

```bash
git clone https://TUDelft-CITG/coastpy.git
cd coastpy
mamba env create -f environment.yml
jupyter lab
```

## Data

The data that is produced with this software can be directly accessed via the cloud using
tools like
[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/?version=stable&environment=cli&platform=macos&download_method=package_manager);
see the [tutorials](./tutorials/) for other methods and latest instructions.

### Global Coastal Transect System (GCTS)

Cross-shore coastal transects are essential to coastal monitoring, offering a consistent
reference line to measure coastal change, while providing a robust foundation to map
coastal characteristics and derive coastal statistics thereof.

The Global Coastal Transect System consists of more than 11 million cross-shore coastal
transects uniformly spaced at 100-m intervals alongshore, for all OpenStreetMap
coastlines that are longer than 5 kilometers.


```bash
# Download all transects in the United States.
duckdb -c "COPY (SELECT * FROM 'az://coclico.blob.core.windows.net/gcts/release/2024-08-02/*.parquet' AS gcts WHERE gcts.country = 'US') TO 'United_States.parquet' (FORMAT 'PARQUET')"
```

```bash
# Or, download the data in bulk using AZ CLI
az storage blob download-batch \
    --destination "./" \
    --source "gcts" \
    --pattern "release/2024-08-02/*.parquet" \
    --account-name coclico
```
