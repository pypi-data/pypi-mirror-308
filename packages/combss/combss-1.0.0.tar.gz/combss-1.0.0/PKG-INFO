# combss
This is the package for COMBSS, a novel continuous optimisation method toward best subset selection, developed from the paper Moka et al. (2024)

## Dependencies

This package relies on the following libraries:

- `numpy` (version 1.21.0 or later): Numerical computing.
- `scipy` (version 1.7.0 or later): Sparse matrix operations and linear algebra.
- `scikit-learn` (version 1.0.0 or later): Machine learning and evaluation metrics.

These will be installed automatically if you install the package via `pip`. Alternatively, they can also be installed manually.
