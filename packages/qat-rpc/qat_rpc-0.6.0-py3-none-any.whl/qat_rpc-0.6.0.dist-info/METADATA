# QAT-RPC

This package provides RPC (Remote Procedure Call) tooling for use with the OQC 
[QAT](https://oqc-community.github.io/qat/main/index.html) (Quantum Assembly Toolchain) compiler and runtime.

## Installation

### PyPI

The QAT-RPC package has not yet been released to PyPI.

### Building from Source

We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management and run on
[Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Once both of these are installed run this in the root folder to install all the dependencies that you need: `poetry install`

> If you are contributing to the project we recommend that you also run
> `poetry run pre-commit install`
> to enable pre-commit checks.
