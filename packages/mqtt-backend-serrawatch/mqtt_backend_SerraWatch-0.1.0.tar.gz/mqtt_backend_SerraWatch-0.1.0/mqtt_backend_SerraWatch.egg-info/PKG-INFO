# Client_OnUbuntu
This project was created as part of the Internet of Things (IoT) course in the Master's program in Computer Architecture at the Haute École de la Province de Liège (HEPL). Its objective is to demonstrate the design, development, and integration of IoT solutions to meet real-world needs in terms of connectivity and automation. This project puts into practice technical skills such as programming embedded devices, wireless communication, and designing intelligent and interactive systems.

The focus is on using hardware like the Raspberry Pi and various sensors, while integrating communication protocols such as MQTT to illustrate key IoT principles and promote a hands-on learning approach.

If anyone finds any security vulnerabilities, I would be happy to discuss them.
