# USE AT OWN RISK!
#
# Just running 'tox' tests an absurd number of combinations of versions,
# and quickly fills up your hard drive with virtualenvs.
# Some pandas versions may not have wheels for your platform, and compiling
# from scratch takes many eons.
#
# This is not part of the normal testing workflow, it's mainly meant to hunt
# for incompatibilities with pandas. You can run single test environments e.g.
#
#     tox -e py39-gurobipy100-pandas14
