class Sensor(Component, Subscriber):
    """Base class for a sensor. `Sensors`s may be attached to an `Agent` and will allow them to "sense" the current state of the environment. A sensor does this by taking "sense actions", which are read only actions. sense actions occur as part of `__sense__` in the agents cycle.

    Sensing often happens without an explicit decision made by the agent. The `__sense__` method can be overriden to continuously (once per cycle) take a set of sense actions.

    __Example__:
    ```
    class MySensor(Sensor):
        def __sense__(self):
            # new actions should always be created, do not re-use events!
            return [GetPositionAction()]
    ```

    These observations are then avaliable in the agents cycle via the `iter_observations` method.

    Example:
    ```
    class MyAgent(Agent):
        def __cycle__(self):
            for observation in self.my_sensor.iter_observations():
                print(observation)  # update beliefs or make decisions
    ```
    Note that `iter_observations` will consume the observations, more will not be avaliable until the next cycle (after the next round of sensing).

    Sensors may also take advance of `star_ray`s pub-sub mechanism (`Sensor` implements the `Subscriber` interface) and can subscribe to passively receive certain types of event. The `__subscribe__` method may be used for this purpose, it is called once automatically upon initialisation of the sensor (after it is has been attached to an agent) and should return a list of `Subscribe` actions. The sensors observations will then automatically be populated with any published data that it subscribed to. Note that it is up to the environment to define what data is made avaliable to a sensor (i.e. what `Publisher`s exist).

    Like actuators, sensors may be defined with a number of "attempt" methods. These methods are decorated with the `@attempt` decorator. The decorator ensures that the action is prepared for execution after the agent has decided upon it. Since sensing happens __before__ the call to `__cycle__` (see `Agent` class documentation for details), decisions to actively sense are made on the previous cycle.

    A typical example might look as follows:
    ```
    class MyAgent(Agent):
        def __cycle__(self):
            self.my_sensor.move(self.direction)


    class MySensor(Sensor):
        @attempt()
        def get_position(self):
            # this action is defined according to the environments state API.
            return GetPositionAction()
    ```

    An attempt method will always return the action that the agent wishes to take. It is possible to directly pass an action to an attempt method, in which case the method might simply return it:
    ```
    @attempt()
    def sense(self, action: Action):
        return action
    ```
    More often, there will be some additional steps inside the attempt method which prepares the action for execution. This simplifies the logic present inside the agents `__cycle__` method and can allow for some more generic setups where the agent is unaware of the implementation details of an action.

    Sensors can also attached to agents that subclass `AgentRouted`, which will allow for automatic routing of received observations to methods defined in the agent that are decorated with `@observe`. As with actuators, the same kind of action routing can be done (see `Actuator` class documentation for details).
