"""Module defines the decorator `@attempt`.

The `@attempt` decorator should be used on methods that are meant to take actions in `Actuator` and `Sensor` components. It is also used in the automatic routing of actions to relevant components as implemented in the `AgentRouted` class. See these classes and the `attempt` documentation for details.

    """A decorator that defines an `attempt` method within a `Component`. `attempt` methods should be called in the agent's `__cycle__` method to schedule an action for execution. This is true of both actuators and sensors.

    Args:
        event_types (List[Type]): A list of types that the decorated `Component` method will receive if event routing is enabled. If this is not specified then an attempt will be made to discover the types via the type hint of the first argument of the decorated function.

    Sensors: `Sensor` actions will be attempted at the start of the next cycle (before the next `__cycle__` is called).
    Actuators: `Actuator` actions will be attempted at the end of the agents current cycle (after `__cycle__` has finished).

    For an action the properly scheduled for execution it must be returned by the decorated method (see example below).

    Example:
    ```
    class MyActuator(Actuator):
        @attempt
        def move(self, direction):
            return MoveAction(direction)


    class MyAgent(Agent):
        def __cycle__(self):
            # the action will be executed after __cycle__ is finished.
            self.actuators[0].move("EAST")
