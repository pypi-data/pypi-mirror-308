    # Observe, Decide, Attempt

    Three decorators are used to enable this routing.

    - `observe`: used to route observations from sensors to methods in the agent.
    - `decide` : used to route decisions (or actions) from the agent to type-compatible actuators (specifically their `attempt` methods).
    - `attempt` : used in actuators and sensors as a destination for routed decisions/actions (originating in decide methods).

    `observe` and `decide` are used to decorate methods in the agent.
    `attempt` is used to decorate methods in the agents components (sensors and actuators), recall that it is also used to schedule action for execution during `__sense__` (for sensors) and `__execute__` (for actuators).

    Methods decorated with any of the three are called during `__cycle__`.

    Example:
    ```
    class MyAgent(RoutedAgent):
        @observe
        def my_revise(self, observation: MyObservation, component: Component):
            pass  # observations of type `MyObservation` will be sent here from sensors (or actuators)

        @decide
        def my_decide(self) -> MyDecision:
            return MyDecision()  # send to the type-compatible actuator

        @decide
        def my_sense(self) -> MySense:
            return MySense()  # send to the type-compatible sensor


    class MyActuator(Actuator):
        @attempt
        def my_attempt(self, decision: MyDecision) -> MyAction:

        @attempt

    For more details on each decorator, see their respective documentation.

    Methods that have been decorated with `observe` and `decide` are automatically discovered, but it is also possible to manually add functions via the `add_observe` and `add_decide` methods. The added function does not need to be an instance method.

    During `__cycle__` the following methods dunder methods are called: `__observe__`, `__decide__`.

    - `__observe__` is responsible for routing observations from sensors to type-compatible observe methods.
    - `__decide__` is responsible for routing decisions (or actions) from decide methods to type-compatible actuators (attempt methods).
