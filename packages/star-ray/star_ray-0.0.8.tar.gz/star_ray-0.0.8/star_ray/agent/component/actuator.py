    """Base class for an actuator. `Actuator`s may be attached to an `Agent` and will allow them to take actions to mutate the environment state. They run as part of `__execute__` in the agents cycle.

    Like sensors, actuators are typically defined with a number of "attempt" methods. These methods are decorated with the `@attempt` decorator. The decorator ensures that the action is prepared for execution after the agent has decided upon it.

    A typical example might look as follows:
    ```
    class MyAgent(Agent):
        def __cycle__(self):
            self.my_actuator.move(self.direction)


    class MyActuator(Actuator):
        @attempt()
        def move(self, direction: float):
            return MoveAction(direction)
    ```

    An attempt method will always return the action that the agent wishes to take. It is possible to directly pass an action to an attempt method, in which case the method might simply return it:
    ```
    @attempt()
    def take(self, action: Action):
        return action
    ```
    More often, there will be some additional steps inside the attempt method which prepares the action for execution. This simplifies the logic present inside the agents `__cycle__` method and can allow for some more generic setups where the agent is unaware of the implementation details of an action.

    In some situations we may want an actuator to always take some action (or set of actions) regardless of the agents decision. In this case we can override the `__attempt__` method, see method documentation for details.

    Actuators can also attached to agents that subclass `AgentRouted`, which will allow for automatic routing of decisions to their respective actuators (we don't need to call attempt methods explicitly) see this class for details.
