"""Package that defines agent related functionality.

Important classes:
    - `Agent` : the base class for an agent.
    - `Component` : the base class for a component (see `Actuator` and `Sensor`).
    - `Actuator` : A component that allows the agent to take actions in its environment.
    - `Sensor` : A component that allows an agent to observe its environment.

Other useful classes:
    - `AgentRouted` : An implementation of `Agent` that automatically routes actions/observations to assocaited actuators/sensors (based on types).

See respecitve class documentation for details.
