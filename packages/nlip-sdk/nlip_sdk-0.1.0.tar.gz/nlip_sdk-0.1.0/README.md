# NLIP SDK

The NLIP SDK provides the basic functionality that is needed to implement the NLIP protocol, either on the client side or on the server side. The server side requires additional packages. The NLIP SDK is targeted primarily at NLIP clients. 

The NLIP SDK contains the following modules: 

* utils.py - A set of basic utility routines that simplify implementation. 
* errrors.py - A set of error definitions that help diagnose in development. 
* nlip.py - The definition of the NLIP message formats.
