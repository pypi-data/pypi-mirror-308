A desktop tool to monitor GitHub Pull Requests with native notifications.

The code is pretty bad, as it was mostly written by claude-sonnet 3.5.

It works though, for the most part, and I've checked it to make sure it's not doing anything crazy.

This was equally about creating a useful tool for work, as well as playing around with LLMs.
