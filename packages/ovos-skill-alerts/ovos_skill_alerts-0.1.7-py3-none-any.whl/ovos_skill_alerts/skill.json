    "description": "The skill provides functionality to create alarms, timers, reminders and todo (lists), remove them by name, time, or type, and ask for what is active. If you choose to syncronize with a DAV server, you can also access your reminders and todo lists from other devices. Alarms and reminders may be set to recur daily or weekly. An active alert may be snoozed for a specified amount of time while it is active. Any alerts that are not acknowledged will be added to a list of missed alerts that may be read and cleared when requested. If you were away, your device was off, or the device was napping, ask for a summary of what was missed. The number of notifications missed can be seen on the upper left corner of the Home screen.",
