## We list here *all* extra non-standard files we want included in
## source distributions.  We list all, even those that setuptools
## picks up automatically --- at the moment setuptools picks up
## COPYING and README.md and ignores NEWS.md.  We list them all
## because 1) we never know when setuptools changes their mind on what
## files to include by default; 2) we may use an older version of
## setuptools; or 3) we may move away from setuptools to another build
## tool and tehn we already have a list of the files here.
##
## Note we do not use package_data from setuptools.  That is for files
## that will be included in the binary distribution, i.e., needed at
## runtime.  We only want these files in the source distribution, they
## are for user information.

include COPYING
include NEWS.md
include README.md
