In this library, we are focusing on the Image Classification task, which
requires the AI model to classify images into different preset names
(categories).

We believe this is the beginning how we can train AI models and guide
them to know the world, because as you can see since from the `ImageNet`
competition, the performance of AI models has been improving
significantly, with the rapid development of deep learning techniques,
resulting in the advancement of artificial intelligence.

That’s why we named our library the `NamableClassify`, borrowing the
“Old Master” ’s philosophy.
