# Next steps:
# * The onion decomposition
# https://www.nature.com/articles/srep31708
#
# Idea: make a k-shell decomposition (recursively remove nodes of degree <= k
# from the graph until there are no more, then do the same for k+1), but keep
# track of which/how nodes are removed for each pass *within* a shell, and not
# just what the k value is.
