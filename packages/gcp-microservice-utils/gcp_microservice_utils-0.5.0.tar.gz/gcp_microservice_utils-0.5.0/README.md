This library aims to reduce the boilerplate code required for instrumenting Python microservices with essential GCP services. It provides convenient wrappers and helper functions for:

- Cloud Logging: Easily log structured data with severity levels and custom attributes.
- Cloud Trace: Automatically trace requests across your microservices, enabling distributed tracing and performance analysis. Â  
- Authentication: Includes Flask middleware to seamlessly process authentication results from GCP API Gateway, simplifying security integration.
