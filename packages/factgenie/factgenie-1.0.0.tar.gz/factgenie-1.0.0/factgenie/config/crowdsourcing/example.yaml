annotator_instructions: |
  In this task, you will annotate outputs of an automatic text generation system. For each example, you will see **data** on the left side and the corresponding generated **text** on the right side. Your task is to **annotate errors** in the text with respect to the data.

  There are four types of errors that you can mark in the generated text:

  1.  <span style="background-color: #FFBCBC"><b>Incorrect fact</b></span>: The fact in the text contradicts the data.
  2.  <span style="background-color: #e9d2ff"><b>Not checkable</b></span> : The fact in the text cannot be checked given the data.
  3.  <span style="background-color: #FFF79F"><b>Misleading</b></span>: The fact in the text is misleading in the given context.
  4.  <span style="background-color: #bbbbbb"><b>Other</b></span> : The text is problematic for another reason, e.g. grammatically or stylistically incorrect, irrelevant, or repetitive.

  You can annotate the errors by selecting the appropriate error category and dragging your mouse over the text, highlighting the error span.
  
  Once you think you have marked all the errors present in the text, click the **âœ… Mark example as complete** button (you can still update the annotation later). 
  
  You will be able to submit the annotations once they are all are marked as complete.
