# BulkFlow

A high-performance Python package for efficiently loading large CSV datasets into PostgreSQL databases. Features chunked processing, automatic resume capability, and comprehensive error handling.

## Key Features

- 🚀 **High Performance**: Optimized chunk-based processing for handling large datasets efficiently
- 🔄 **Resume Capability**: Automatically resume interrupted imports from the last successful position
- 🛡️ **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging and failed row tracking
- 🔍 **Data Validation**: Preview data before import and validate row structure
- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates with ETA and processing speed
- 🔄 **Duplicate Handling**: Smart handling of duplicate records
- 🔌 **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management
- 📝 **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all operations and errors

## Installation

```bash
pip install bulkflow
```

## Quick Start

1. Create a database configuration file (`db_config.json`):
```json
{
    "dbname": "your_database",
    "user": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": "5432"
}
```

2. Run the import:
```bash
python -m bulkflow.main path/to/your/file.csv your_table_name
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from bulkflow import process_file

db_config = {
    "dbname": "your_database",
    "user": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": "5432"
}

process_file(file_path, db_config, table_name)
```

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
python -m bulkflow.main data.csv target_table

# Custom config file
python -m bulkflow.main data.csv target_table --config my_config.json
```

## Error Handling

BulkFlow provides comprehensive error handling:

1. **Failed Rows File**: `failed_rows_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`
   - Records individual row failures
   - Includes row number, content, error reason, and timestamp

2. **Import State File**: `import_state.json`
   - Tracks overall import progress
   - Enables resume capability
   - Records failed chunk information

## Performance Optimization

BulkFlow automatically optimizes performance by:

- Calculating optimal chunk sizes based on available memory
- Using connection pooling for database operations
- Implementing efficient duplicate handling strategies
- Minimizing memory usage through streaming processing
