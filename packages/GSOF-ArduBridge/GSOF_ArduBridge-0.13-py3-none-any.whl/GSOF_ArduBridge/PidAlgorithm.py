Class to build an Enhanced-PID-Controller function.
The controller includes the following fetures:
- Rise-Time and Settle-Time measurements on each command.
- Enhanced antiwindup algorithm for the integrator.
- Configurable integrator limits.
- Configurable output limits.

The NextStep function should be called on periodic bases with new
control, feedback and Ts values.
It returns the new output value.
The class stores its state.

"""
Python class for implementing a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controller.
PID controllers are used in control systems to maintain a given setpoint by continuously calculating
and adjusting the control input based on the error between the setpoint and the current process value.
The class has several features, including the ability to measure the rise time and settle time of each command,
an enhanced anti-windup algorithm for the integrator, and configurable limits for the integrator and output.

The class has several variables:

Kp: Proportional gain
Ki: Integral gain
Kd: Derivative gain
ctrl: The setpoint value
feedback: A list of the current and previous two feedback values
error: A list of the current and previous two errors between the setpoint and feedback values
delta: The proportional component of the control input
sum: The integral component of the control input
diff: The derivative component of the control input
output: The final control input after combining the proportional, integral, and derivative components
outMax: Maximum output value
outMin: Minimum output value
sumMax: Maximum integral component value
sumMin: Minimum integral component value
cycle: The current cycle number
The class has one method: NextStep(self, ctrl, feedback, dt), which should be called periodically with new control, feedback, and Ts values. It returns the new output value. The method updates the values of the class variables based on the current and previous control, feedback, and error values. It then combines the proportional, integral, and derivative components to calculate the final control input and applies limits to the output. Finally, it increments the cycle number.
