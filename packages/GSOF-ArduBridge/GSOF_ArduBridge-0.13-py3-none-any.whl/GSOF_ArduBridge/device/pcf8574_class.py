Python class for interacting with the PCF8574 I2C 8-Bit I/O expander.
The PCF8574 is a 8-bit input/output (I/O) expander that can be used to add additional I/O capabilities.
It communicates with the host device via I2C and has an interrupt output that can be used to signal when the device's input pins have changed.

The class has several methods:
__init__(self, i2c, dev=0x20): The constructor for the class.
It initializes the class with an I2C object and the device address of the PCF8574 (0x20 by default).

_checkPin(self, pin): Helper method that checks if a pin number within the range 0 to 7.
If the pin number is invalid, it raises a ValueError.

getPort(self): Reads the current state of all of the device's input pins and returns it as a single byte.

setPort(self, val): Sets the state of all of the device's output pins based on a single byte.
The least significant bit of the byte corresponds to the first output pin and the most significant bit corresponds to the last output pin.

getPin(self, pin): Reads the current state of a single input pin and returns it as a 0 or 1.

digitalRead(self, pin): Alias for getPin.

setPin(self, pin, val): Sets the state of a single output pin to either 0 or 1.

digitalWrite(self, pin, val): Alias for setPin. It emulates the digitalWrite function from the Arduino API.

pinPulse(self, pin, onTime): Pulses an output pin by setting it to 1 for a specified amount of time and then setting it back to 0.

togglePin(self, pin): Inverts the state of a single output pin.
If the pin is currently 0, it sets it to 1, and if it is currently 1, it sets it to 0.
