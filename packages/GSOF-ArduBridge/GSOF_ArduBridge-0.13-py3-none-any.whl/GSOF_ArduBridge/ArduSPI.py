Class to access the Arduino-Bridge SPI bus.
It uses the BridgeSerial class object to communicate over serial with the 
GSOF-Arduino-Bridge firmware.
The setMode method is used to set the mode of the SPI communication,
which determines the clock polarity (CPOL) and clock phase (CPHA) of the
communication. The write_read method is used to write data to the device and
receive data from it in a single operation.
It takes a list of bytes as an argument and sends them to the device,
then receives and returns the response from the device.
The setOff method is used to turn off the SPI communication.

The packet has a binary byte based structure
To write:
<'3'>,<TXD1>,<TXD2>...<TXDn>, <0x1b>
<''>, <RXD1>,<RTD2>...<RDXn>, <0x1b>
e.g, to write the value 0x14, 0x15 and 0x16 use:
['3', 0x14, 0x15, 0x16 0x1b]
In respond you three bytes will be reveived
