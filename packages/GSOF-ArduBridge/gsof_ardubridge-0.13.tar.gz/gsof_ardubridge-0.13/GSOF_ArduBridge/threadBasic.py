Class to build a simple periodic or single-shot thread.
When building the Class-Object you should supply a name (string) and a period time (float in Sec).
To start the thread use the objects mothod start() e.g: Obj.start()
To stop the thread use the objects mothod stop() e.g: Obj.stop()
To pause the thread use the objects mothod start() e.g: Obj.pause()
To continue the thread use the objects mothod cont() e.g: Obj.cont()
Your code should be located in the rocess method
