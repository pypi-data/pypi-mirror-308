Python class for interacting with the PCF8591 I2C 8-Bit 4 channel ADC + DAC.
It communicates with the host device via I2C and has an interrupt output that can be used to signal when the device's input pins have changed.

The class has several methods:
__init__(self, i2c, dev=0x20): The constructor for the class.
It initializes the class with an I2C object and the device address of the PCF8591 (0x48 by default).

digitalRead(self, pin, thrs): Reads the current state of a single input pin and returns it as a 0 or 1.

setPin(self, pin, val, high): Sets the state of a single output pin to either 0 or 1.

digitalWrite(self, pin, val, high): Alias for setPin. It emulates the digitalWrite function from the Arduino API.
