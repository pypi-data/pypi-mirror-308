This code defines a class called ADS1115 that is a subclass of ads1x15_class.ADS1x15.
It is used to interface with an ADS1115 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) over an I2C interface.
The class has several attributes to define the: possible data rates, the gain settings,
and the resolution of the ADC. It also has several constants for the ADC's input pins.

The _conversion_value method converts a binary ADC value to a voltage using the ADC's gain setting and resolution.
It also handles negative values by appling the two's complement method.
The getRatesList method returns a list of the possible data rates for the ADC, sorted in ascending order.
The getRates method returns a dictionary of the data rate configuration masks.
