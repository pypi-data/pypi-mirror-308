Class to access the Arduino-Bridge PulseAndSample (I/O) command.
This class is using the BridgeSerial class object to communicate over serial
with the GSOF_ArduinoBridge firmware.

The command will generate a pulse on pinPulse while sampling the adcPin for N samples
The packet has a binary byte based structure
byte0 - 'C' for pulse ans sample command
byte1 - pulsePin number (binary-value)
byte2 - adcPin number (binary-value)
byte3 - N samples (binary-value)
"""

"""
The ArduBridgePnS class is used to generate a pulse on pulsePin and sample the adcPin for samples number of samples. The pulseAndSample method of this class sends a command to the Arduino to execute this pulse and sample operation and receives the resulting sample values. The measCap method is not implemented and currently does not do anything.
