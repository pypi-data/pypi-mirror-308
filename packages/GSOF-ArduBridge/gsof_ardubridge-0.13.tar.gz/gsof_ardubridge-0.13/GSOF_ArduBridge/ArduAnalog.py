The class provides methods for interacting with the analog inputs and outputs of an Arduino via a serial connection.
It uses the BridgeSerial object to communicate over serial with the GSOF_ArduinoBridge firmware.

The packet has a binary byte based structure
byte0 - 'P' for PWM-Out, 'A' for Analog-In
byte1 - pin bumber (binary-value)
byte2 - pwm-value (binary-value) only for analog-out command
