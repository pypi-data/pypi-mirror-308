Class to calculate moving average, variance and standard deviation.
"""


"""
This code is used to calculate and update the moving average and variance of an input data stream.
The Stat_Recursive_X_Array class maintains a cyclic buffer of fixed size N,
where N is the number of input data points in the anasamble.
The update() method is used to add a new data point to the cyclic buffer, replacing the oldest data point,
and returning the value of the oldest data point that was removed.
The Ex() method returns the current mean.
The Var() and Stddev methods returns the current variance and standard-deviation.
The Ex2() method returns the current average of the squares of the data points.

The Cyclic_Array class is used to maintain the cyclic buffer of data points.
It has an update() method that is used to add a new data point to the buffer, replacing the oldest data point,
and returning the value of the oldest data point that was removed.
The E() function calculates the average of a list of data points. If a second list is provided,
it calculates the dot product of the two lists and returns the average of the result.
