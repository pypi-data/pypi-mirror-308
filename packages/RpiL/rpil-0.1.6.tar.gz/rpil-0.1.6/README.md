# RpiL - Raspberry Pi Library

RpiL is a simple Python library for controlling Raspberry Pi hardware, particularly GPIO pins. It provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with various hardware components like motors, LEDs, and sensors. The library is designed to streamline GPIO operations, making it ideal for both beginners and advanced users working on Raspberry Pi projects.

## Features
- Simple control of GPIO pins
- Supports various hardware components (LEDs, motors, sensors, motor drivers, RGB LEDs, buzzers, IR things, etc...)
- Easy-to-understand API for quick integration
- LIBRARY IS NOT INSTALLABLE ON ANYTHING OTHER THAN RASPBERRY PI DUE TO DEPENDANCIES SUCH AS RPi.GPIO
  * This will be fixed soon, _I promise_

## Documentation
- All detailed documentation, including installation and usage instructions, is available on the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/TrynaThinkOf1/RpiL/wiki).
- The PyPI is here: https://pypi.org/project/RpiL/
