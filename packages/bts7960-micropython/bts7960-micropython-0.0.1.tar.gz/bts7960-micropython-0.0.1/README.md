# bts7960-micropython

`bts7960-micropython` is a Python library to control a motor driver using the **BTS7960 H-Bridge** IC. This library allows you to control the motor speed and direction through PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals using a microcontroller like the ESP32 or ESP8266.

## Features

- Control motor direction (forward/reverse)
- Control motor speed (from -100 to 100)
- Easy-to-use API for integrating into projects

## Installation

### Install via pip (once available on PyPI)

```bash
pip install bts7960-micropython
