Given that the initial values for both directions are equal (15 seconds each), and the feedback suggests optimizing further, we need to consider the traffic patterns indicated by 'Time lost per vehicle' for each direction. High 'Time lost per vehicle' values suggest longer green light durations might be required to reduce vehicle delays in that direction. For instance, East to West and East to North directions have considerably high time lost per vehicle, indicating that the East-West green light duration might need to be increased to accommodate the heavier traffic flow from East. Similarly, while North to West, North to East, and South to East have lower time lost per vehicle, suggesting balanced or slightly increased green light duration for North-South could help, we should also avoid reducing the North-South time significantly as it seems already balanced. Therefore, a slight increase in EW time and a smaller adjustment or maintaining the NS time could help in balancing the delays further and reducing the overall score.\",\n",

The current settings result in an overall score of approximately 44.99, indicating that there may be room for optimization in the light durations to achieve a more balanced and efficient flow of traffic. The feedback prompts for further optimization, implying that the current settings are not yet optimal. Given that both `int0` (EW_time) and `int1` (NS_time) are within their constraints but may not be optimally set, the strategy should involve adjusting these durations to attempt to balance the waiting times and reduce the overall score. The ideal values likely exist between the extremes of their defined ranges, since too high or too low values for either direction would cause imbalances in traffic flow, as mentioned in the instructions. The values to try next should consider the feedback that the current settings are not optimal and attempt to reduce the 'Time lost per vehicle' for each direction, ultimately reducing the 'OVERALL SCORE'. Adjusting these values with a focus on minor increments could help identify a more optimal balance.\",\n",

Given that both int0 (EW_time) and int1 (NS_time) were initially set to equal durations (25 seconds each), the OVERALL SCORE resulted in 85.8145253129838, which is indicated as not optimal according to the feedback received. The goal is to adjust these times within their respective constraints ([15, 90] seconds) to find a more balanced approach that reduces the average delay and overall intersection score. The trips attempted, completed, and time lost per vehicle data indicate varying levels of congestion in different directions, suggesting that adjusting the balance between EW and NS green times could address these imbalances. Decreasing or increasing the duration of green lights for either direction can affect the flow of traffic, potentially reducing queue times and the overall score. Considering these factors, it is logical to experiment with adjusting the durations slightly but not too drastically, observing the constraints. A slight increase in one direction and a slight decrease or maintenance in the other may find a better balance, reducing delays.\",\n",

The goal is to find a balance between these two durations to ensure that delays for all directions are minimized, enhancing traffic flow. The current values of int0=23 and int1=27 yield an OVERALL SCORE of 122.93479991296886, indicating there is room for improvement. To optimize further, consider that the ideal values should efficiently balance the delays for North-South and East-West directions. Based on the output, it's clear that while some delays are reasonably low (e.g., for N1-W1, N1-E1, N1-S1, S1-W1, S1-E1, and S1-N218), others, especially involving E1 as a starting node, are quite high. This suggests that the balance is off, possibly requiring a reduction in the East-West duration to allow more time for the North-South direction or vice versa. Given that constraints allow for significant adjustment within a range of [15,90] for both directions, we have flexibility in our adjustments.\",\n",

Given the feedback, the initial settings of 20 seconds for East-West (EW_time=int0) and 30 seconds for North-South (NS_time=int1) resulted in an overall score of 212.4335264055084, which suggests there's room for improvement. The goal is to adjust these durations within the constraints (15 to 90 seconds) to achieve a lower overall score. Since the feedback implies that the current settings may not be optimal, adjusting these values could help find a balance that reduces vehicle queuing and delays in all directions. The detailed delay information for each direction suggests that both North-South and East-West directions are not perfectly balanced, with some directions experiencing significantly higher time lost per vehicle than others. This indicates that tweaking the green light durations could indeed optimize traffic flow. Since the feedback specifically asks for further optimization without indicating whether the current distribution leans heavily towards favoring either East-West or North-South traffic, an educated guess towards achieving a better balance could be to slightly reduce the time for the direction that has a longer green phase (in this case, North-South) and increase the time for the other direction (East-West), aiming for a more equitable distribution of green light duration, thereby potentially reducing the overall delay.\",\n",

The feedback suggests that the chosen values of 25 seconds for both directions have led to an OVERALL SCORE of 85.8145253129838, which indicates room for improvement. To achieve a lower score, we could try adjusting the values to respond more effectively to the specific traffic patterns indicated by the feedback. For example, it appears that trips from E1 to W1 have a significantly higher 'Time lost per vehicle' compared to trips from N1 to W1, indicating potential over-prioritization of the NS direction. Similarly, the 'Time lost per vehicle' from E1 to N1 and E1 to S1 suggest that the EW direction might be under-prioritized. We can infer that adjusting the EW and NS times to better accommodate these traffic patterns could lead to a lower overall delay and thus a lower OVERALL SCORE. A possible direction is to slightly increase EW time to alleviate the high delays seen in east-west movements and slightly decrease NS time, provided we keep within the constraints of 15-90 seconds for both.\",\n",

The given scores suggest that while there has been some success in managing delays (with an average delay of 11.085356880058868), there's significant room for improvement, given that the feedback asks for further optimization. We notice that the time lost per vehicle for East to West and vice versa is comparatively high, indicating potentially excessive green light duration in one direction causing delays in the other. Adjusting the green light duration closer to a balanced value might reduce the overall delays experienced by vehicles from all directions, thus lowering the overall score. Considering the constraints that the duration can only be between 15 to 90 seconds, and aiming to balance the durations more effectively without favoring one direction excessively over the others, we could try incrementally adjusting both values to study the impact on the overall score. Since the initial set values are int0=30 for East-West and int1=20 for North-South, and the feedback suggests optimization, we could experiment by slightly increasing the NS duration and/or adjusting the EW duration to achieve a better balance.\",\n",

The initial values for both directions (int0 for East-West and int1 for North-South) are set to 25. Given that the OVERALL SCORE is 85.8145253129838, there is a need to adjust these values to find a balance that reduces this score. The overall score likely represents a combination of the average delay, the number of trips completed versus attempted, and the time lost per vehicle. Since we don't have specific information on the traffic distribution or how the scoring is precisely calculated, the optimization will involve adjusting these values to strike a balance between waiting times across all directions. We can infer from general traffic management principles that if one direction consistently has higher waiting times or loss times, reducing its green light duration (and potentially increasing it for the opposing direction) can help balance the flow. However, extreme balances should be avoided; both values must stay within the constraints of 15 to 90 seconds. Based on the feedback, adjusting the green light durations may help improve traffic flow efficiency and reduce the OVERALL SCORE.\",\n",

The OVERALL SCORE takes into account the average delay, time lost per vehicle, and other performance metrics. Given that both EW and NS durations are set equitably at 30, and observing that the overall score is deemed sub-optimal according to the feedback, it's clear a trade-off needs to be found that better accommodates the actual traffic flow patterns in all directions. Ideally, adjusting the durations would strike a balance that minimizes delays and maximizes the number of trips completed in all directions. The particular values for adjustment should consider the constraints provided (between 15 to 90 seconds) and aim at fine-tuning the distribution of green light time to reflect the demand revealed in the outputs (for example, areas with higher trips attempted and lower trips completed might benefit from longer green times). Without specific data on traffic patterns from the outputs, an educated trial to improve scores can be made by slightly adjusting the durations to favor the direction showing higher delays or incomplete trips.\",\n",

An OVERALL SCORE of 50.16598605909516 suggests there is room for improvement in the traffic light timing to either reduce or better balance the time vehicles spend waiting, thereby optimizing the overall traffic flow and reducing the score. Given that adjustments to 'int0' and 'int1' values influence the duration vehicles in each direction are allowed to move, the key is to find a set of values that minimizes delays for all directions effectively. The current settings of 'int0=35' and 'int1=25' suggest a longer green light duration for the East-West direction compared to the North-South direction, potentially indicating a misbalance in favor of East-West trips. To improve the OVERALL SCORE, a reevaluation of these durations based on the observed delays and completed trips for each direction is necessary. It might be beneficial to reduce the East-West green light time slightly while increasing the North-South duration to provide a more balanced approach, taking into account the constraints of [15,90] for both variables. This can potentially reduce queuing and delays, hence improving the OVERALL SCORE.\",\n",
