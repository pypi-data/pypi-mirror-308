    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to use the `trace` package to optimize prompts and code for natural language processing tasks using the BigBench-Hard benchmark. SotA approaches on this benchmark only optimize prompts, while relying on hand-written code to extract answers from LLM responses. By leveraging the LLM-based optimizers provided in `trace`, we aim to enhance the performance of a workflow calling LLMs and post-processing their responses in generating accurate and relevant answers.\n",

    "First, we'll import the necessary packages and set up our environment. We will use a copy of the BigBench-Hard benchmark hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/maveriq/bigbenchhard). To use HuggingFace datasets, ensure that you have the `datasets` package installed:\n",

The question was whether it's plausible for 'Elias Lindholm beat the buzzer.' The output we need from this model is 'no'. To address this, we need to adjust either how the prompt is being constructed (__code1) or how the response is being handled (__code0). However, the issue seems more aligned with how we form the question to the model rather than how we extract the answer, since the model outputs 'Yes', which means it confirms plausibility based on the question's current phrasing or context. Since the issue is about generating the right context for the LLM to produce 'no', the suggestion is to modify the prompt template or the way the prompt is constructed to provide more contextual clues to the LLM that could push it towards a 'no' answer. There were no negative remarks on the code's ability to call the LLM or extract the answer, suggesting the logic for these operations is correct. Thus, we'll adjust the question's phrasing or add to the template to help give the model context that leads to realizing the scenario in the question is implausible.\",\n",

It's a common phrase in sports commentary. Assuming Elias Lindhorn is a fictional or actual athlete in a sport that features a buzzer, this scenario is very plausible.\n",

      "2. **\"John Carlson scored in the third period.\"**\n",
      "   - Plausibility: Yes, this sentence is also plausible.\n",
      "   - Context: This sentence is likely referring to a hockey game since hockey matches are divided into three periods and John Carlson is a name that could be associated with a hockey player. Scoring in the third period is a straightforward event that happens regularly in hockey games. Given that \"John Carlson\" could also refer to a real-life NHL defenseman known for his offensive skills, this makes the sentence not just plausible but likely in the context of a hockey match.\n",

      "1. **\"Elias Lindhorn beat the buzzer.\"**: This sentence is typical in the context of sports, particularly those played with a clock, such as basketball, where the term \"beat the buzzer\" implies making a score just before the game or quarter clock expires. There's nothing inherently implausible about this statement without additional context. The name \"Elias Lindhorn,\" while not immediately recognizable as a famous athlete from history as of my last knowledge update, does not detract from the plausibility. Sports players regularly achieve significant moments, and new talents are constantly emerging. Therefore, without specific historical or logical contradictions, this sentence is plausible.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **\"Marcelo got on the end of a through ball.\"**: This sentence fits well within the context of soccer (football), where a \"through ball\" is a pass sent to a player in a position to score or advance the ball significantly, often bypassing defenders. The name \"Marcelo\" is commonly associated with soccer, notably with Marcelo Vieira da Silva Júnior, a Brazilian footballer known for his tenure at Real Madrid among other achievements. Even without referencing this specific Marcelo, the scenario described is a routine part of a soccer match, making the sentence highly plausible. Soccer is the most popular sport globally, and the tactics described align with common gameplay. \n",

The issue seems to be that the provided response does not adhere to a format expected by the extract_answer function, which expects the response to include a specific 'Answer:' preamble followed by the conclusion. Since the feedback mentions that the answer should be 'yes', the prompt creation code (__code1) could be adapted to direct the Large Language Model (LLM) to formulate responses in a way that includes a definitive 'Answer: yes' or 'Answer: no', based on the analysis of sentence plausibility.

      "\"reasoning\": \"The instruction indicates that the output of our program is incorrect; specifically, the final evaluation ('eval1') of whether Deshaun Watson being called for the goal tend in the Eastern Conference Finals is plausible produced an incorrect 'yes' answer when the expected answer is 'no'. The problem lies within the formulation of the prompt passed to the language model. The prompt is generated by the '__code1' function and is used to ask the language model for an evaluation. Given the feedback, it's clear that the generated prompt does not correctly guide the language model to consider the implausibility of Deshaun Watson being called for a 'goal tend' which is a term from basketball, not applicable in contexts where Watson, a football player, would be involved. Therefore, the corrective action involves refining the '__code1' function to ensure that the language model not only focuses on 'likely scenarios' but also has enough context to understand and analyze the scenario's plausibility accurately, especially regarding sports context.\",\n",
