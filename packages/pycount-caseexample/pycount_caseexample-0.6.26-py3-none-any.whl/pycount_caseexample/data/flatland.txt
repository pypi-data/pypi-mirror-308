	"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions" by Edwin Abbott Abbott is a satirical novella written in the late 19th century. The story is set in a two-dimensional world inhabited by geometric shapes, where societal hierarchy is determined by the number of sides one possesses. The narrative's main character, A Square, provides insights into the rigid class structure and the challenges of perceiving dimensions beyond his own flat existence. The opening of the novella introduces the reader to Flatland, a bizarre and mathematically constructed world. A Square, the narrator, describes the inhabitants and their perceptions, shaped by their two-dimensional reality. One particularly notable aspect is the method of recognition among the residents, which relies heavily on hearing and touch since sight is limited to lines. Abbott humorously critiques social norms and implies deeper philosophical questions regarding perception, knowledge, and dimensions as A Square becomes aware of the existence of a higher, three-dimensional space. This sets the stage for a broader exploration of dimensions and understanding beyond the confines of his world. (This is an automatically generated summary.)
