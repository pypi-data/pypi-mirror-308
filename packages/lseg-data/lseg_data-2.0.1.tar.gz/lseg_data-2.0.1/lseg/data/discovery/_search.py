    This class describe parameters to retrieve data for search.

    Parameters
    ----------
    query: str, optional
        Keyword argument for view

    view: Views or str, optional
        The view for searching see at Views enum.
        Default: Views.SEARCH_ALL

    filter: str, optional
        Where query is for unstructured end-user-oriented restriction, filter is for
        structured programmatic restriction.

    order_by: str, optional
        Defines the order in which matching documents should be returned.

    boost: str, optional
        This argument supports exactly the same predicate expression syntax as filter,
        but where filter restricts which documents are matched at all,
        boost just applies a large scoring boost to documents it matches,
        which will almost always guarantee that they appear at the top of the results.

    select: str, optional
        A comma-separated list of the properties of a document to be returned in the response.

    top: int, optional
        the maximum number of documents to retrieve. Must be non-negative.
        default: 10

    skip: int, optional
        The number of documents to skip in the sorted result set before returning the
        next top.

    group_by: str, optional
        If specified, this must name a single Groupable property.
        returned documents are grouped into buckets based on their value for this
        property.

    group_count: str, optional
        When supplied in combination with group_by, sets the maximum number of documents
        to be returned per bucket.
        default: 3

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import lseg.data as ld
    >>> df = ld.discovery.search(query="cfo", view=ld.discovery.Views.PEOPLE)
