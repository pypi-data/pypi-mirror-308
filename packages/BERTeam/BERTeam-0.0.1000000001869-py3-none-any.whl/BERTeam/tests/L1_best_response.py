    #   looks like it can learn to optimize, but it forgets sometimes and optimizes something else, leading to 'spikes'

    #   it puts more distribution on optimal guy, but it seems to have difficulty learning languagy things

    #   seems to learn distribution in 'spikes' still, and the spikes grow to approach the correct distribution
