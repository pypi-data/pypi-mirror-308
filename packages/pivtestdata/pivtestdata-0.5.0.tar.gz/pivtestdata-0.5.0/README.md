# PIV Test Data

This repository provides the interface to PIV test data, which is freely available on the internet, so all credit goes
to the original authors!!! Available datasets in this repository can be found under these links:

* [PIV Challenge 2001](https://www.pivchallenge.org/)
* [ILA Vortex PAIR](https://www.pivtec.com/download.html)
* [ILA Boundary Layer PAIR](https://www.pivtec.com/download.html)

Intended use of this package is to have a convenient interface to PIV sample data to test PIV algorithms.

**Note**, that the data is not stored in this repo but it assists in downloading it from the respective websites on
demand. Once downloaded, the repo helps you to retrieve the file names quickly from a local user folder.
