        """
        Contains grids of (y,x) Cartesian coordinates at the centre of every pixel in the dataset's image and
        mask, which are used for performing calculations on the datas.

        The following grids are contained:

        - `uniform`: A grids of (y,x) coordinates which aligns with the centre of every image pixel of the image data,
        which is used for most normal calculations (e.g. evaluating the amount of light that falls in an pixel
        from a light profile).

        - `non_uniform`: A grid of (y,x) coordinates which aligns with the centre of every image pixel of the image
        data, but where their values are going to be deflected to become non-uniform such that the adaptive over
        sampling scheme used for the main grid does not apply. This is used to compute over sampled light profiles of
        lensed sources in PyAutoLens.

        - `pixelization`: A grid of (y,x) coordinates which again align with the centre of every image pixel of
        the image data. This grid is used specifically for pixelizations computed via the `inversion` module, which
        can benefit from using different oversampling schemes than the normal grid.

        - `blurring`: A grid of (y,x) coordinates which are used to compute the blurring of the image data. This image
        contains the light of all pixels that are masked, but are close enough to the unmasked pixels that their light
        will be convolved into the unmasked pixels by the PSF.

        Every grid has its own `over_sampling` class which defines how over sampling is performed for these grids and
        is described in the corresponding `over_sampling.py` module.

        This is used in the project PyAutoGalaxy to load imaging data of a galaxy and fit it with galaxy light profiles.
        It is used in PyAutoLens to load imaging data of a strong lens and fit it with a lens model.
