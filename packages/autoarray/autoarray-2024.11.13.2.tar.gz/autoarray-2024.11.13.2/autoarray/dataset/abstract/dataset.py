        """
        An abstract dataset, containing the image data, noise-map, PSF and associated quantities for calculations
        like the grid.

        This object is extended with specific dataset types, such as an `Imaging` or `Interferometer` dataset,
        and can be used for fitting data with model data and quantifying the goodness-of-fit.

        The following quantities are abstract and used by any dataset type:

        - `data`: The image data, which shows the signal that is analysed and fitted with a model image.

        - `noise_map`: The RMS standard deviation error in every pixel, which is used to compute the chi-squared value
        and likelihood of a fit.

        The dataset also has a number of (y,x) grids of coordinates associated with it, which map to the centres
        of its image pixels. They are used for performing calculations which map directly to the data and have
        over sampling calculations built in which approximate the 2D line integral of these calculations within a
        pixel. This is explained in more detail in the `GridsDataset` class.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data
            The array of the image data containing the signal that is fitted (in PyAutoGalaxy and PyAutoLens the
            recommended units are electrons per second).
        noise_map
            An array describing the RMS standard deviation error in each pixel used for computing quantities like the
            chi-squared in a fit (in PyAutoGalaxy and PyAutoLens the recommended units are electrons per second).
        noise_covariance_matrix
            A noise-map covariance matrix representing the covariance between noise in every `data` value, which
            can be used via a bespoke fit to account for correlated noise in the data.
        over_sampling
            The over sampling schemes which divide the grids into sub grids of smaller pixels within their host image
            pixels when using the grid to evaluate a function (e.g. images) to better approximate the 2D line integral
            This class controls over sampling for all the different grids (e.g. `grid`, `grids.pixelization).
