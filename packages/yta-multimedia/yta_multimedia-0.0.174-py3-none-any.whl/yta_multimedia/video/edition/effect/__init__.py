    This method will apply the provided 'effect' (if valid) to the also
    provided whole 'video' and will return the new clip with the effect
    applied.

    You can pass any effect customization parameter through the 'kwargs'
    parameters, but I recommend you to avoid this method and instantiate
    a valid 'effect', passing the 'video' to the initializer and using 
    the '.apply()' method like in this line below:
    > BlurMoviepyEffect(video).apply()

    The text above is easier for the developer because can check the 
    parameters accepted by the effect in the initializing process.
