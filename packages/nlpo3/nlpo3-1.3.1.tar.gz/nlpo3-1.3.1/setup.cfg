long_description = 
	Python binding for nlpO3, a Thai natural language processing library in Rust.
	
	
	- Thai word tokenizer
	- use maximal-matching dictionary-based tokenization algorithm and honor Thai Character Cluster boundaries
	- use user-supplied dictionary
	- 2.5x faster than similar pure Python implementation
	
	
	```bash
	pip install nlpo3
	```
	
	
	Load file `path/to/dict.file` to memory
	and assigned it with name `custom_dict`.
	
	Then tokenize a text with `custom_dict` dictionary:
	```python
	from nlpo3 import load_dict, segment
	
	load_dict("path/to/dict.file", "custom_dict")
	segment("สวัสดีครับ", "custom_dict")
	```
	
	it will return a list of strings:
	```python
	['สวัสดี', 'ครับ']
	```
	(result depends on words included in the dictionary)
