# fsdetection

**fsdetection** is a Python package for few-shot object detection, inspired by the simplicity and flexibility of Hugging Face libraries. With `fsdetection`, you can quickly experiment with few-shot learning for object detection tasks, easily integrate it with popular frameworks, and customize detection models with minimal data.

## Features
- **Few-Shot Object Detection**: Fine-tune object detection models with only a few examples per class.
- **Cross-Domain Adaptation**: Effortlessly adapt models to new domains.
- **Modular Design**: Build and customize models with a clean, intuitive API.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Access a range of pre-trained models as a starting point for your tasks.

## Installation

Install `fsdetection` directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install fsdetection
```
