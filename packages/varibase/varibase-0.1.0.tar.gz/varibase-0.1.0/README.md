
# Varibase: Never Lose Your Variables Again!

Ever closed your Jupyter notebook by accident and immediately regretted it?
Or maybe your notebook decided to crash just when you had the perfect variable ready for analysis? 😱

Fear no more! __Varibase__ is here to save your day (and your variables)! 🦸‍♂️

This package was born out of frustration and necessity after repeatedly losing variables because I didn’t feel like rerunning the entire notebook for that one tiny value. So, I created __Varibase__—a simple, efficient, and life-saving (at least for devs) __tool to store and retrieve variables effortlessly.__

If you:

Lose variables like you lose your car keys 🗝️,
Hate running notebooks from the top just to recreate one little variable 🤦‍♂️,
Want to focus on scripting, not saving variables 🧑‍💻,
Varibase is for you. 💾✨

**No more variable loss. No more frustration. Just happy scripting.**
