# pytest_defer - A "defer" fixture for pytest


```python
def test_example(defer):
    # All functions appended to defer will execute at test end in reverse order
    instance1 = spin_instance()
    defer.append(delete_instance, instance1)  # called second
    instance2 = spin_instance()
    defer.append(delete_instance, instance2, timeout=30)  # called first

    # Test code using instance1 & instance2
    ...
```

## Development
