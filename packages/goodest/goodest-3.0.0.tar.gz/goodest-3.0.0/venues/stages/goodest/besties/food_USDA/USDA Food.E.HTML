		<h3>measured ingredient structures</h3>
		
			The structure of the measured ingredients 
			is not given by the API.
			
			Therefore, some assumptions about the
			measured ingredients are made.
			
			This is different from the NIH API, where the 
			structure of the measured ingredients is
			given.
	
	
	
	
	<h2>utilitity</h2>
		
		retrieve and parse a new food "nature":
			#
			#	This retrieves a food's data from USDA.	
			#
			import goodest.besties.food_USDA.deliveries.one as retrieve_1_food
			food_USDA = retrieve_1_food.presently (
				FDC_ID = 2642759,
				API_ellipse = ""
			)
			
			#
			#	This parses USDA foods into the nature format.
			#
			#		This should use the shared:
			#			goodest.shows.natures
			#
			import goodest.besties.food_USDA.nature as food_USDA_nature
			nature = food_USDA_nature.create (food_USDA ["data"])
		
		
		structure is is "shows/nature"
