## The Lean Solution for Managing FASTQ and NGS Data

ReadStore is a platform for storing, managing, and integrating genomic data. It accelerates analysis and offers an easy way to manage and share FASTQ and NGS datasets. With built-in project and metadata management, ReadStore structures your workflows, and its collaborative user interface enhances teamwork â€” so you can focus on generating insights.

The integrated web service allows you to retrieve data directly from ReadStore via the terminal Command-Line Interface (CLI) or through Python and R SDKs.

The ReadStore Basic version provides a local web server with simple user management. For organization-wide deployment, advanced user and group management, or cloud integration, please check out the ReadStore Advanced versions and contact us at info@evo-byte.com.

## Description

The ReadStore Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool for uploading and managing your genomic data. With the ReadStore CLI, you can upload FASTQ files directly to the ReadStore database, as well as access and manage Projects, Datasets, metadata, and attachment files with ease.

The CLI can be run from your shell or terminal and is designed for seamless integration into data pipelines and scripts, enabling efficient automation of data management tasks. This flexibility allows you to integrate the ReadStore CLI within any bioinformatics application or pipeline, streamlining data uploads, access, and organization within ReadStore.

By embedding the ReadStore CLI in your bioinformatics workflows, you can improve efficiency, reduce manual tasks, and ensure your data is readily accessible for analysis and collaboration.

## Security and Permissions<a id="backup"></a>

**PLEASE READ AND FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY!**

### User Accounts and Token<a id="token"></a>

Using the CLI with a ReadStore server requires an active User Account and a Token. You should **never enter your user account password** when working with the CLI.

To retrieve your token:

1. Login to the ReadStore web app via your browser
2. Navigate to `Settings` page and click on `Token`
3. If needed you can regenerate your token (`Reset`). This will invalidate the previous token

For uploading FASTQ files your User Account needs to have `Staging Permission`. If you can check this in the `Settings` page of your account. If you not have `Staging Permission`, ask the ReadStore server Admin to grant you permission.

### CLI Configuration

After running the `readstore configure` the first time, a configuration file is created in your home directory (`~/.readstore/config`) to store you credentials and CLI configuration.

The config file is created with user-excklusive read-/write permissions (`chmod 600`), please make sure to keep the file permissions restricted.

You find more information on the [configuration file](#cliconfig) below.

## Installation

`pip3 install readstore-cli`

You can perform the install in a conda or venv virtual environment to simplify package management.

A local install is also possible

`pip3 install --user readstore-cli`

Make sure that `~/.local/bin` is on your `$PATH` in case you encounter problems when starting the server.

Validate the install by running

`readstore -v`

This should print the ReadStore CLI version

## Usage

Detailed tutorials, videos and explanations are found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk-WMGySW9ySUfZU25NyA5YgzmHQ7yquv) or on the [**EVO**BYTE blog](https://evo-byte.com/blog).

### Quickstart

Let's upload some FASTQ files.

#### 1. Configure CLI

Make sure you have the ReadStore CLI installed and a running ReadStore server with your user registered.

1. Run `readstore configure`

2. Enter your username and [token](#token)
3. Select the default output of your CLI requests. You can choose between `text` outputs, comma-separated `csv` or `json`.
4. Run `readstore configure list` and check if your credentials are correct. 

#### 2. Upload Files

For uploading FASTQ files your User Account needs to have `Staging Permission`. If you can check this in the `Settings` page of your account. If you not have `Staging Permission`, ask the ReadStore Server Admin to grant you permission.

Move to a folder that contains some FASTQ files

`readstore upload myfile_r1.fastq`

This will upload the file and run the QC check. You can select multiple files at once using the `*` wildcard.
The fastq files need to have the default file endings `.fastq, .fastq.gz, .fq, .fq.gz`.

#### 3. Stage Files

Login to the web app on your browser and move to the `Staging` page. Here you find a list of all FASTQ files that you just uploaded. For larger files, the QC step can take a while to complete.

FASTQ files are grouped into Datasets which you can `Check In`. Checked In Datasets appear in the `Datasets` page and can be accessed by the CLI.

#### 4. Access Datasets via the CLI

The ReadStore CLI enables programmatic access to Datasets and FASTQ files. Some examples are:

`readstore list`  List all FASTQ files

`readstore get --id 25`  Get detailed view on Dataset 25

`readstore get --id 25 --read1-path`  Get path for Read1 FASTQ file

`readstore get --id 25 --meta`  Get metadata for Dataset 25

`readstore project get --name cohort1 --attachment`  Get attachment files for Project "cohort1"

You can find a full list of CLI commands below.


### CLI Configuration<a id="cliconfig"></a>

`readstore configure` manages the CLI configuration. To setup the configuration:

1. Run `readstore configure`

2. Enter your username and [token](#token)
3. Select the default output of your CLI requests. You can choose between `text` outputs, comma-separated `csv` or `json`.
4. Run `readstore configure list` and check if your credentials are correct. 

If you already have a configuration in place, the CLI will ask whether you want to overwrite the existing credentials. Select `y` if yes.

After running the `readstore configure` the first time, a configuration file is created in your home directory (`~/.readstore/config`).
The config file is created with user-excklusive read-/write permissions (`chmod 600`), please make sure to keep the file permissions restricted.

```
[general]
endpoint_url = http://localhost:8000
fastq_extensions = ['.fastq', '.fastq.gz', '.fq', '.fq.gz']
output = csv

[credentials]
username = myusername
token = myrandomtoken
``` 

You can further edit the configuration of the CLI client from this configuration file. In case your ReadStore Django server is not run at the default port 8000, you need to update the `endpoint_url`. If you need to process FASTQ files with file endings other than those listed in `fastq_extensions`, you can modify the list.

### Upload FASTQ Files<a id="upload"></a>

For uploading FASTQ files your User Account needs to have `Staging Permission`. You can check this in the `Settings` page of your account. If you do not have `Staging Permission`, ask the ReadStore Server Admin to grant you permission.

`readstore upload myfile_r1.fastq myfile_r2.fastq ...`

This will upload the files and run the QC check. You can select several files at once using the `*` wildcard. It can take some time before FASTQ files are available in your `Staging` page depending on how large file are and how long the QC step takes.

```
usage: readstore upload [options]

Upload FASTQ Files

positional arguments:
  fastq_files  FASTQ Files to Upload
```

### Import FASTQ files from .csv Template

You can also import FASTQ files defined in a .csv template files.

`readstore import fastq fastq_templates.csv`

The template .csv must contain the columns `FASTQFileName`,`ReadType` and `UploadPath`

- FASTQFileName: Name of the FASTQ file (used to group FASTQ files in datasets and set default dataset name)
- ReadType: Should be R1, R2, I1 or I2 for for Read1/2 or Index1/2
- UploadPath: FASTQ file path. ReadStore server needs read permissions to file.

```
usage: readstore import fastq [options]

Import FASTQ Files

positional arguments:
  fastq_template  FASTQ Template .csv File
```

### Access Projects<a id="projectaccess"></a>

There are 3 commands for accessing projects, `readstore project list`, `readstore project get` and `readstore project download`.
