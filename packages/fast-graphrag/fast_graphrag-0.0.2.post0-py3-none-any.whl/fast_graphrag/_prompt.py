# DOMAIN
{domain}

# GOAL
Given a document that is potentially relevant to the given domain and a list of entity types, first, identify all present entities of those types and, then, all relationships among the identified entities.
The entities will be grouped according to their relationships and used by decision-makers to generate reports and answer domain-specific questions. Your goal is to highlight information that is relevant to the domain and the questions that may be asked on it.

Examples of possible domain-specific questions:
{example_queries}

# STEPS
1. Identify all entities. Make sure to identify all relevant entities. Make sure to resolve pronouns to their specific named entities.
2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all relationships between pairs of (source_entity, target_entity).

# EXAMPLE DATA
Entity types: [person, role, technology, organization, event, location, concept]

Their voice slicing through the buzz of activity. "Control may be an illusion when facing an intelligence that literally writes its own rules," they stated stoically, casting a watchful eye over the flurry of data.
"It's like it's learning to communicate," offered Sam Rivera from a nearby interface, their youthful energy boding a mix of awe and anxiety. "This gives talking to strangers' a whole new meaning."
Alex surveyed his team—each face a study in concentration, determination, and not a small measure of trepidation. "This might well be our first contact," he acknowledged, "And we need to be ready for whatever answers back."
Together, they stood on the edge of the unknown, forging humanity's response to a message from the heavens. The ensuing silence was palpable—a collective introspection about their role in this grand cosmic play, one that could rewrite human history.
The encrypted dialogue continued to unfold, its intricate patterns showing an almost uncanny anticipation
