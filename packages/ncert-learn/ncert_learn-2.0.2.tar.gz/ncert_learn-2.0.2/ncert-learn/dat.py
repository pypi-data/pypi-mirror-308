m='''
Here’s a brief explanation of each topic in Python for Class 12 students, broken down by each major concept as per the NCERT syllabus. You can use this as a guide or as study material for students.

1. Basic Operations
Input and Output: In Python, input() is used to take input from the user, and print() is used to display output. For example:


name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}")
Arithmetic Operations: Python allows basic arithmetic operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulus (%), and exponentiation (**).


a = 5
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Output: 8
2. Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)
Conditionals: Conditional statements help us make decisions in a program. The if statement runs a block of code if the condition is True, elif is used for additional checks, and else runs if all conditions are False.

Example:


x = 10
if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif x == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Negative")
3. Loops (for, while)
For Loop: Used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, string, or range). It repeats a block of code a fixed number of times.


for i in range(5):  # Will print numbers 0 to 4
    print(i)
While Loop: Executes a block of code as long as the given condition is True.


i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
4. Functions
Functions: Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks. You define a function with the def keyword, and it can take inputs (parameters) and return outputs.

Example:


def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}"

print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice
Functions help in breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks.

5. String Manipulation
Strings: Strings are sequences of characters. You can perform various operations like concatenation, slicing, and case conversion.


text = "Hello World"
print(text.upper())  # Output: "HELLO WORLD"
print(text[0:5])     # Output: "Hello"
String Methods:

upper(): Converts to uppercase.
lower(): Converts to lowercase.
replace(): Replaces a substring.
Example:


greeting = "Hello"
greeting = greeting.replace("e", "a")  # Output: "Hallo"
6. Lists
Lists: Lists are ordered collections that can store multiple items of different types. You can add, remove, and access elements in a list.

Example:


fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("orange")  # Add to the end
fruits.remove("banana")  # Remove item
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'cherry', 'orange']
7. Dictionaries
Dictionaries: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique and is used to access the corresponding value.

Example:


student = {"name": "John", "age": 18, "marks": 90}
print(student["name"])  # Output: John
student["age"] = 19  # Update value
8. File Handling
File Handling: Python can read from and write to files using the open() function. You can open a file in different modes (r for read, w for write, etc.).

Example:


# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")

# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)  # Output: Hello, World!
9. Algorithms (Prime, Armstrong, etc.)
Prime Numbers: A prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and only divisible by 1 and itself.

Example of checking if a number is prime:


def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
Armstrong Numbers: An Armstrong number is a number where the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits is equal to the number itself.

Example:


def is_armstrong(num):
    digits = [int(digit) for digit in str(num)]
    power = len(digits)
    total = sum(d ** power for d in digits)
    return total == num
10. SQL (Structured Query Language)
SQL is used to interact with relational databases. It allows you to insert, update, delete, and query data in a database.

Database Connection: To interact with databases in Python, the sqlite3 module is commonly used. Here’s an example of how to connect and run SQL queries.

import sqlite3

# Connecting to SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('students.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Creating a table
cursor.execute(\'\'\'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER)\'\'\')

# Inserting data
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO students (name, age) VALUES ('Alice', 18)")

# Querying data
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM students")
print(cursor.fetchall())  # Fetches all rows

conn.commit()
conn.close()
11. Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out)
A stack is a linear data structure where elements are added or removed from the same end. It follows the LIFO principle: the last element added is the first one to be removed.

Example of implementing a stack:


class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []

    def push(self, item):
        """Pushes an item onto the stack."""
        self.stack.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        """Pops an item from the stack."""
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.stack.pop()
        else:
            return "Stack is empty"

    def is_empty(self):
        """Checks if the stack is empty."""
        return len(self.stack) == 0

    def peek(self):
        """Returns the top element without removing it."""
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.stack[-1]
        else:
            return "Stack is empty"
12. Queue (FIFO - First In, First Out)
A queue is a linear data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front. It follows the FIFO principle: the first element added is the first one to be removed.

Example of implementing a queue:


class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        """Adds an item to the queue."""
        self.queue.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        """Removes an item from the queue."""
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.queue.pop(0)
        else:
            return "Queue is empty"

    def is_empty(self):
        """Checks if the queue is empty."""
        return len(self.queue) == 0

    def front(self):
        """Returns the front element without removing it."""
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.queue[0]
        else:
            return "Queue is empty"
13. CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
CSV is a file format used to store tabular data. Python provides the csv module to read from and write to CSV files.

Example of reading and writing CSV files:


import csv

# Writing to a CSV file
with open('data.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Name', 'Age', 'Country'])
    writer.writerow(['Alice', 18, 'USA'])
    writer.writerow(['Bob', 20, 'UK'])

# Reading from a CSV file
with open('data.csv', mode='r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
14. Binary Files
Binary files are files that contain data in binary format (0s and 1s). You can read and write binary files using Python's built-in open() function with the 'b' mode.

Example of reading and writing binary files:


# Writing to a binary file
with open('example.bin', 'wb') as file:
    data = b'\\x00\\x01\\x02\\x03\\x04'
    file.write(data)

# Reading from a binary file
with open('example.bin', 'rb') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)  # Output: b'\\x00\\x01\\x02\\x03\\x04'
15. Exceptions and Error Handling
Exceptions are runtime errors that occur in Python. You can handle these errors using try, except, else, and finally blocks to prevent the program from crashing.

Example of error handling:


def divide(a, b):
    try:
        result = a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "Error: Division by zero"
    except TypeError:
        return "Error: Invalid input types"
    else:
        return result
    finally:
        print("Execution complete.")

print(divide(10, 0))  # Output: Error: Division by zero
Common Python Errors:

ZeroDivisionError: Raised when dividing by zero.
TypeError: Raised when an operation is applied to an object of inappropriate type.
IndexError: Raised when an invalid index is accessed in a list.
ValueError: Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but inappropriate value.
16. Recursion
Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It is important to define a base case to avoid infinite recursion.

Example of calculating factorial using recursion:


def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
17. Sets
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are useful for performing operations like union, intersection, and difference.

Example of set operations:


set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

# Union
print(set1 | set2)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

# Intersection
print(set1 & set2)  # Output: {3, 4}

# Difference
print(set1 - set2)  # Output: {1, 2}
18. Tuples
Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable. Once created, you cannot modify their values.

Example of tuple operations:


tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4)
print(tuple1[0])  # Output: 1
19. Lambda Functions
Lambda functions are small anonymous functions defined with the lambda keyword. They are typically used for short, throwaway functions.

Example of a lambda function:


square = lambda x: x * x
print(square(5))  # Output: 25
20. List Comprehensions
List Comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. It allows you to transform one list into another by applying an expression.

Example of list comprehension:


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = [x**2 for x in numbers]  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
Conclusion
With these additional topics, Class 12 students will have a broad understanding of Python and related concepts. By learning these, students will be equipped to handle a wide variety of problems, from database operations with SQL to advanced data structures like stacks, queues, and recursion.
These topics will also provide a strong foundation for future studies in computer science, data science, and software development.'''

To work with MySQL databases in Python, you can use the mysql-connector-python library. This allows you to interact with MySQL databases, execute queries, and handle data. Here's how you can install and use MySQL Connector for Python.

1. Installation
First, you need to install the mysql-connector-python package. You can install it using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install mysql-connector-python
2. Connecting to a MySQL Database
To connect to a MySQL database, you need the hostname, username, password, and database name.

Here’s how to connect to the MySQL database:


import mysql.connector

# Establishing the connection
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",       # MySQL server hostname or IP
    user="your_username",   # MySQL username
    password="your_password",  # MySQL password
    database="your_database"   # Database name
)

# Creating a cursor object
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Checking the connection
if conn.is_connected():
    print("Successfully connected to MySQL database!")

# Don't forget to close the connection
conn.close()
3. Creating a Database and Table
Once connected, you can create a database and a table for storing your data.

Example to create a database and a table:


# Establish connection
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password"
)

cursor = conn.cursor()

# Creating a database
cursor.execute("CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS studentDB")

# Selecting the database
conn.database = 'studentDB'

# Creating a table
cursor.execute("""
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    age INT NOT NULL,
    grade VARCHAR(10)
)
""")
print("Database and Table Created Successfully!")

conn.close()
4. Inserting Data into a Table
You can insert data into your MySQL database using the INSERT INTO SQL statement.

Example to insert data into the students table:


# Connecting to the database
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    database="studentDB"
)

cursor = conn.cursor()

# Inserting data into the students table
cursor.execute("""
INSERT INTO students (name, age, grade)
VALUES (%s, %s, %s)
""", ("Alice", 18, "A"))

# Commit the transaction
conn.commit()

print("Data inserted successfully!")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
5. Retrieving Data from a Table
To retrieve data, you use the SELECT SQL statement.

Example to fetch all records from the students table:


# Connecting to the database
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    database="studentDB"
)

cursor = conn.cursor()

# Fetching data from the students table
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM students")

# Fetching all results
result = cursor.fetchall()

for row in result:
    print(row)

# Close the connection
conn.close()
6. Updating Data in a Table
To update existing data, you can use the UPDATE SQL statement.

Example to update the grade of a student:


# Connecting to the database
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    database="studentDB"
)

cursor = conn.cursor()

# Updating data in the students table
cursor.execute("""
UPDATE students
SET grade = %s
WHERE name = %s
""", ("B", "Alice"))

# Commit the transaction
conn.commit()

print("Data updated successfully!")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
7. Deleting Data from a Table
To delete data, you can use the DELETE SQL statement.

Example to delete a student record:


# Connecting to the database
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    database="studentDB"
)

cursor = conn.cursor()

# Deleting data from the students table
cursor.execute("DELETE FROM students WHERE name = %s", ("Alice",))

# Commit the transaction
conn.commit()

print("Data deleted successfully!")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
8. Handling Exceptions
When working with databases, it's important to handle exceptions that may occur during database operations.

Example of exception handling in MySQL queries:

python
Copy code
try:
    conn = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="your_username",
        password="your_password",
        database="studentDB"
    )

    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Example query that could raise an exception
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM non_existing_table")

except mysql.connector.Error as err:
    print(f"Error: {err}")
finally:
    if conn.is_connected():
        conn.close()
9. Closing the Connection
Remember to always close the connection after you're done with your database operations to free up resources.


if conn.is_connected():
    conn.close()
    print("Connection closed")
Conclusion
This brief overview shows how to connect to a MySQL database using mysql-connector-python, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and handle basic errors. This will be helpful for Class 12 students to integrate database operations into their Python programs.

You can combine these operations with other topics, such as SQL queries, data analysis, and user interaction, to build a complete project or solve real-world problems using Python.'''

1. Python Basics
Data Types
Python supports several built-in data types:

int: Integer numbers (e.g., 5, -10)
float: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.001)
str: Strings of characters (e.g., "hello", 'Python')
bool: Boolean values (True, False)
list: A collection of ordered elements (e.g., [1, 2, 3])
tuple: An immutable collection (e.g., (1, 2, 3))
dict: A collection of key-value pairs (e.g., {"name": "John", "age": 18})
set: A collection of unique unordered elements (e.g., {1, 2, 3})
NoneType: A special type representing None (used for null values)
Variables and Constants
Variables hold data of any data type and can be reassigned.
Constants are typically written in uppercase letters, but Python does not have a built-in constant data type.
2. Control Flow
Conditional Statements
if: Executes a block of code if the condition is True.
elif: Checks additional conditions if the if condition is False.
else: Executes when all the previous conditions are False.
Example:


x = 10
if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif x == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Negative")
Loops
for loop: Used to iterate over a sequence (like lists, ranges).
while loop: Repeats a block of code as long as the condition is True.
Example:


# For loop example
for i in range(1, 6):  # From 1 to 5
    print(i)

# While loop example
x = 0
while x < 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
Break and Continue
break: Exits the loop prematurely.
continue: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
3. Functions
Defining Functions
Functions help you organize your code into smaller, reusable parts. Functions are defined using the def keyword.

Example:


def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
Arguments and Return Values
You can pass parameters to functions and return values using the return keyword.
default arguments: You can set default values for parameters.
variable-length arguments: Use *args and **kwargs for a variable number of arguments.
Example with default argument:


def greet(name="Student"):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet())          # Output: Hello, Student!
print(greet("Alice"))   # Output: Hello, Alice!
4. Data Structures
Lists
Lists are mutable, ordered collections that can store mixed data types.
Operations on lists:

Append: Adds an item to the end.
Remove: Removes an item by value.
Pop: Removes an item by index and returns it.
Example:


fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("orange")  # Adds "orange" to the list
fruits.remove("banana")  # Removes "banana"
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'cherry', 'orange']
Tuples
Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).
Example:


colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
# colors[0] = "yellow"  # This will raise an error since tuples are immutable
Dictionaries
Dictionaries store key-value pairs. Keys are unique, and values can be of any data type.
Example:


student = {"name": "John", "age": 18, "marks": 90}
print(student["name"])  # Output: John
student["age"] = 19  # Update age
Sets
Sets are unordered collections with unique elements.
Example:


unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3}
print(unique_numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}
5. File Handling
Python provides built-in methods to work with files, allowing you to read from and write to files.

Reading from a File

with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Writing to a File

with open("file.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!")
Handling CSV Files
Use the csv module to read and write CSV files.


import csv

# Writing to CSV
with open("data.csv", mode="w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Name", "Age", "Country"])
    writer.writerow(["Alice", 18, "USA"])

# Reading from CSV
with open("data.csv", mode="r") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
6. MySQL with Python
Connecting to MySQL Database

import mysql.connector

conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="root",
    password="yourpassword",
    database="yourdatabase"
)

cursor = conn.cursor()
Executing SQL Queries
Example of creating a table:


cursor.execute("""
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    age INT,
    grade VARCHAR(10)
)
""")
CRUD Operations in MySQL
Insert Data:

cursor.execute("""
INSERT INTO students (name, age, grade)
VALUES (%s, %s, %s)
""", ("Alice", 18, "A"))
conn.commit()
Select Data:

cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM students")
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    print(row)
Update Data:

cursor.execute("""
UPDATE students
SET grade = %s
WHERE name = %s
""", ("B", "Alice"))
conn.commit()
Delete Data:

cursor.execute("DELETE FROM students WHERE name = %s", ("Alice",))
conn.commit()
7. Exceptions and Error Handling
Handling Exceptions
Use try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.


try:
    x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
else:
    print("No error occurred")
finally:
    print("Execution finished.")
8. Recursion
Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It’s important to have a base case to prevent infinite recursion.

Example of calculating factorial recursively:


def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
9. Advanced Topics
Lambda Functions
Lambda functions are small anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword. They are typically used for short, one-line functions.

Example:


square = lambda x: x ** 2
print(square(5))  # Output: 25
List Comprehensions
List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists from other iterables.

Example:


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = [x**2 for x in numbers]
print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
Decorators
Decorators are a way to modify the behavior of a function or class. They are often used for logging, access control, caching, etc.

Example:


def decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before function call")
        func()
        print("After function call")
    return wrapper

@decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()

1. Python Basics
Variables and Data Types
Python allows you to assign values to variables, and it automatically determines the data type based on the value assigned. Below are some examples of basic data types:


# Integers
x = 5
print(x)  # Output: 5

# Floats
y = 3.14
print(y)  # Output: 3.14

# Strings
name = "Alice"
print(name)  # Output: Alice

# Boolean
is_active = True
print(is_active)  # Output: True

# Lists
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Tuple
coordinates = (4, 5)
print(coordinates)  # Output: (4, 5)

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}

# Set
numbers = {1, 2, 3}
print(numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}
2. Conditional Statements
If, Elif, Else
Conditional statements are used to make decisions in your code based on certain conditions.


x = 15

if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")  # Output: x is greater than 10
elif x == 10:
    print("x is equal to 10")
else:
    print("x is less than 10")
3. Loops
For Loop
The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, etc.).


fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Iterating over a list with a for loop
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
Output:


apple
banana
cherry
While Loop
The while loop executes as long as the condition is True.


x = 1
while x <= 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
Output:


1
2
3
4
5
4. Functions
Defining Functions
Functions help break down the code into reusable blocks.


def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
Return and Arguments
Functions can take arguments and return values.


def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8
5. Data Structures
Lists
Lists are ordered collections that can store a variety of data types.


# List with mixed data types
my_list = [1, 3.14, "hello", True]
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 3.14, 'hello', True]

# List operations
my_list.append("new item")
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 3.14, 'hello', True, 'new item']

my_list.remove(3.14)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 'hello', True, 'new item']
Tuples
Tuples are immutable, which means once defined, their values cannot be changed.


my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)

# Accessing an element
print(my_tuple[1])  # Output: 2
Dictionaries
Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs.


person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}

# Accessing values
print(person["name"])  # Output: Alice

# Adding new key-value pair
person["job"] = "Engineer"
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York', 'job': 'Engineer'}
Sets
Sets store unique values and are unordered.


my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}

# Adding to set
my_set.add(5)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
6. File Handling
Reading Files
To read a file, we use the open() function.


# Read from a file (Assuming a file "example.txt" exists)
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Writing to Files
You can write to a file using the write() method.


with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("This is a test.")
Reading and Writing CSV Files
CSV (Comma Separated Values) files can be handled using the csv module.


import csv

# Writing to CSV
with open("students.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Name", "Age", "Grade"])
    writer.writerow(["Alice", 18, "A"])
    writer.writerow(["Bob", 17, "B"])

# Reading from CSV
with open("students.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
Output:


['Name', 'Age', 'Grade']
['Alice', '18', 'A']
['Bob', '17', 'B']
7. Exception Handling
Try and Except Block
You can handle exceptions using try and except blocks.


try:
    x = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
Output:


Cannot divide by zero!
Finally Block
The finally block is always executed, even if there is an exception.


try:
    x = 10 / 2
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error!")
finally:
    print("This is executed no matter what!")
Output:


This is executed no matter what!
8. MySQL with Python
Connecting to MySQL Database
Here is how you can connect to a MySQL database using mysql-connector-python.


import mysql.connector

# Connecting to the database
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    database="your_database"
)

cursor = conn.cursor()

# Creating a table
cursor.execute("""
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    age INT,
    grade VARCHAR(10)
)
""")

conn.commit()
CRUD Operations in MySQL
Insert Data:

cursor.execute("""
INSERT INTO students (name, age, grade)
VALUES (%s, %s, %s)
""", ("John", 18, "A"))
conn.commit()

print("Data inserted successfully!")
Read Data:

cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM students")
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    print(row)
Output:


(1, 'John', 18, 'A')
Update Data:

cursor.execute("""
UPDATE students
SET grade = %s
WHERE name = %s
""", ("B", "John"))
conn.commit()

print("Data updated successfully!")
Delete Data:

cursor.execute("DELETE FROM students WHERE name = %s", ("John",))
conn.commit()

print("Data deleted successfully!")
9. Recursion
Factorial Calculation
Recursion involves a function calling itself. Below is an example of calculating the factorial of a number using recursion.


def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
10. Lambda Functions
Lambda functions are small anonymous functions that can have any number of arguments but only one expression.


# Lambda function to find square of a number
square = lambda x: x ** 2
print(square(4))  # Output: 16
11. List Comprehensions
List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = [x ** 2 for x in numbers]
print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

1. Introduction to Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes simplicity and readability. It is widely used for various applications, such as data analysis, web development, automation, machine learning, and more. Some key features of Python include:

Simple syntax: Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and easy to understand.
Dynamic typing: Variables in Python do not need to be declared with a type; Python will infer the type at runtime.
Interpreted: Python is an interpreted language, meaning it runs directly from the source code without the need for compilation.
Cross-platform: Python can run on different operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS).
Rich standard library: Python comes with a built-in library that provides modules for performing many common tasks (e.g., file I/O, regular expressions, math, etc.).
2. Data Types in Python
Python supports various built-in data types, each with unique properties and functions. Below are the core data types, their characteristics, and some common functions.

Numbers
Python supports three types of numbers: integers (int), floating point (float), and complex numbers (complex).

Integers: Whole numbers without a fractional part.


x = 10
y = -4
Floats: Decimal numbers.


x = 3.14
y = -0.001
Complex: Numbers with real and imaginary parts.


x = 3 + 4j
Functions for Numbers:
abs(x): Returns the absolute value of x.
round(x, n): Rounds x to n decimal places.
pow(x, y): Returns x raised to the power y.
Example:


x = 3.14
print(abs(x))  # Output: 3.14
print(round(x, 1))  # Output: 3.1
Strings (str)
Strings in Python are sequences of characters enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes.

Features:
Strings are immutable.
Strings support indexing and slicing.
Functions for Strings:
len(s): Returns the length of the string s.
s.lower(): Converts all characters to lowercase.
s.upper(): Converts all characters to uppercase.
s.strip(): Removes leading and trailing whitespace.
Example:


text = "  Hello Python!  "
print(len(text))  # Output: 17
print(text.strip())  # Output: Hello Python!
Lists
Lists are ordered, mutable collections that can store elements of any data type.

Functions for Lists:
list.append(x): Adds an element x to the end of the list.
list.remove(x): Removes the first occurrence of x.
list.pop(): Removes and returns the last element.
list.sort(): Sorts the list in place.
Example:


fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("orange")
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']
Tuples
Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable. Once created, you cannot modify a tuple.

Functions for Tuples:
tuple.index(x): Returns the index of the first occurrence of x.
tuple.count(x): Returns the number of occurrences of x in the tuple.
Example:


colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
print(colors.count("green"))  # Output: 1
Dictionaries (dict)
Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs.

Functions for Dictionaries:
dict.get(key): Returns the value for the given key.
dict.keys(): Returns a view of all keys.
dict.values(): Returns a view of all values.
dict.items(): Returns a view of all key-value pairs.
Example:


person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}
print(person["name"])  # Output: Alice
print(person.get("age"))  # Output: 25
Sets
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.

Functions for Sets:
set.add(x): Adds an element x to the set.
set.remove(x): Removes element x from the set.
set.union(other_set): Returns the union of two sets.
Example:


numbers = {1, 2, 3}
numbers.add(4)
print(numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
NoneType
The None type represents the absence of a value or a null value.

Example:


x = None
print(x)  # Output: None
3. Mathematical Functions (math Module)
The math module provides many mathematical functions.

Functions:
math.sqrt(x): Returns the square root of x.
math.factorial(x): Returns the factorial of x.
math.sin(x): Returns the sine of x (in radians).
math.pi: Returns the constant π.
Example:


import math
print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
print(math.factorial(5))  # Output: 120
4. Random Functions (random Module)
The random module is used for generating random numbers.

Functions:
random.randint(a, b): Returns a random integer between a and b.
random.choice(sequence): Returns a random element from the sequence.
random.random(): Returns a random float between 0 and 1.
Example:


import random
print(random.randint(1, 10))  # Output: Random number between 1 and 10
print(random.choice([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: Random element from the list
5. Statistics Functions (statistics Module)
The statistics module provides functions to calculate mathematical statistics of numeric data.

Functions:
statistics.mean(data): Returns the mean (average) of the data.
statistics.median(data): Returns the median of the data.
statistics.stdev(data): Returns the standard deviation of the data.
Example:


import statistics
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(statistics.mean(data))  # Output: 3
print(statistics.stdev(data))  # Output: 1.58
6. Plotting Graphs (matplotlib Library)
The matplotlib library is used for plotting graphs and visualizing data.

Functions:
plt.plot(x, y): Plots a graph with x and y data points.
plt.xlabel(): Sets the label for the x-axis.
plt.ylabel(): Sets the label for the y-axis.
plt.show(): Displays the plot.
Example:


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.show()
7. GUI Development (tkinter Library)
The tkinter library is used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python.

Functions:
tkinter.Tk(): Creates the main window.
Label(): Creates a label widget.
Button(): Creates a button widget.
pack(): Places the widget in the window.
8. Types of Errors in Python
In Python, errors can be categorized into different types. These errors are often classified into Syntax Errors, Runtime Errors, and Logical Errors.

8.1 Syntax Errors (Compile-time Errors)
Cause: These occur when the Python code doesn't follow the proper syntax. They are usually detected during the parsing stage before the program runs.
Examples: Missing parentheses, improper indentation, incorrect function names, etc.
Example:

# Missing parentheses will cause a syntax error
print("Hello, world!"  # SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
Solution: Always ensure proper syntax, especially with parentheses and indentation.

8.2 Runtime Errors (Exceptions)
Cause: These occur while the program is running, typically due to unforeseen situations like dividing by zero, accessing an index that does not exist, or opening a non-existent file.
Examples: ZeroDivisionError, IndexError, FileNotFoundError.
Example:

# This will cause a ZeroDivisionError
x = 10 / 0  # ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
Solution: Handle runtime errors with try-except blocks.

8.3 Logical Errors
Cause: Logical errors occur when the program runs without crashing, but produces incorrect results due to flaws in the program's logic.
Examples: Using incorrect algorithms, making wrong assumptions in calculations, etc.
Example:

# Incorrect logic for calculating the average
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = sum(numbers)
average = total  # Mistake: average should be total / len(numbers)
print(average)  # Output: 15 instead of 3
Solution: Carefully review and debug the logic using print statements or a debugger.

9. Built-in Exceptions
Python provides a variety of built-in exceptions to handle different error scenarios. Here are some common ones:

9.1 ZeroDivisionError
Occurs when attempting to divide a number by zero.


try:
    x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # Output: Error: division by zero
9.2 IndexError
Occurs when trying to access an index that doesn't exist in a list, tuple, or other indexed collections.


lst = [1, 2, 3]
try:
    print(lst[5])  # IndexError: list index out of range
except IndexError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
9.3 FileNotFoundError
Occurs when trying to open a file that doesn't exist.


try:
    with open("nonexistent_file.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # Output: Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'nonexistent_file.txt'
9.4 ValueError
Occurs when a function receives an argument of the correct type, but the value is inappropriate.


try:
    int("abc")  # ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
9.5 TypeError
Occurs when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.


try:
    result = "hello" + 10  # TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
10. Handling Errors with Try, Except, Finally
Python provides the try, except, else, and finally blocks for handling exceptions and ensuring that certain code runs regardless of whether an exception occurred.

10.1 Try and Except Block

try:
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print(f"Number entered: {x}")
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Invalid input, not a number.")
10.2 Finally Block
The finally block will always be executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised.


try:
    file = open("test.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found!")
finally:
    file.close()
    print("File closed.")
11. Assertions
Assertions are used to test if a condition is true during execution. If the condition is false, an AssertionError is raised.


# Assert that a value is positive
x = -5
assert x > 0, "x should be positive!"  # AssertionError: x should be positive!
12. Warnings
Warnings are used to alert users of certain conditions that are not errors, but may need attention. Python provides the warnings module.


import warnings

# Warn the user
warnings.warn("This is a warning message", UserWarning)
Output:


UserWarning: This is a warning message
13. Debugging in Python
Python provides several ways to debug your code:

13.1 Print Statements
A simple approach is using print() to check values during execution.


x = 10
y = 5
print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}")
13.2 Using PDB (Python Debugger)
You can use the built-in pdb module to set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables.


import pdb

x = 5
y = 0
pdb.set_trace()  # Execution will stop here, allowing you to inspect variables.
z = x / y  # Error occurs here
13.3 Using IDE Debuggers
Many IDEs (like PyCharm, VSCode) have built-in debuggers with features like breakpoints, variable inspection, and stack tracing.

14. Conclusion
Python provides a wide range of error handling techniques, including exceptions, assertions, and warnings, which allow you to handle potential issues in your programs gracefully. By using tools like pdb and understanding the different types of errors, you can ensure that your code is more reliable and easier to debug. Always remember to test your code thoroughly and use debugging tools to help identify and fix issues.
15. Functions in Python
A function in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions allow you to write modular, readable, and maintainable code. Functions can be built-in or user-defined.

15.1 User-Defined Functions
User-defined functions allow you to create functions tailored to your specific needs. The syntax for defining a function is as follows:


def function_name(parameters):
    # Function body
    return value
Defining a Simple Function
Here's a basic example of a user-defined function:


def greet(name):
    """This function greets the user with the provided name."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice!
Function Parameters
Positional Parameters: The order of the arguments passed to the function matters.
Keyword Parameters: Parameters passed by name rather than position.
Default Parameters: You can set default values for parameters.
Variable-length Arguments: Functions can accept a variable number of arguments using *args and **kwargs.
Examples:

Positional and Keyword Parameters:


def person_info(name, age):
    print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}")

person_info("John", 25)  # Output: Name: John, Age: 25
Default Parameters:


def greet(name, message="Hello"):
    print(f"{message}, {name}")

greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice
greet("Bob", "Good morning")  # Output: Good morning, Bob
Variable-length Arguments:


def add(*args):
    return sum(args)

print(add(1, 2, 3, 4))  # Output: 10
Keyword Arguments:


def describe_pet(pet_name, animal_type="dog"):
    print(f"I have a {animal_type} named {pet_name}.")

describe_pet(pet_name="Benny")  # Output: I have a dog named Benny.
describe_pet(pet_name="Whiskers", animal_type="cat")  # Output: I have a cat named Whiskers.
15.2 Return Statements
Functions in Python can return values to the caller using the return statement. You can return a single value, a tuple, or even a list.

Example: Function Returning a Value

def square(num):
    return num ** 2

result = square(5)
print(result)  # Output: 25
Example: Function Returning Multiple Values

def multiply_and_divide(x, y):
    return x * y, x / y

product, quotient = multiply_and_divide(10, 2)
print(product, quotient)  # Output: 20 5.0
16. Built-in Functions in Python
Python provides a wide array of built-in functions that are immediately available for use. These functions cover a wide range of use cases, from mathematical operations to input/output handling.

16.1 Common Built-in Functions
print(): Outputs text to the console.


print("Hello, world!")  # Output: Hello, world!
input(): Reads input from the user.


name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
len(): Returns the length of an object (string, list, etc.).


s = "Python"
print(len(s))  # Output: 6
type(): Returns the type of an object.

x = 10
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>
str(), int(), float(): Convert between different data types.


num = 10
print(str(num))  # Output: '10'
sum(): Returns the sum of all elements in an iterable.


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(sum(numbers))  # Output: 10
max(), min(): Return the maximum or minimum of a collection.


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(max(numbers))  # Output: 4
print(min(numbers))  # Output: 1
sorted(): Returns a sorted list of the specified iterable.


numbers = [4, 2, 3, 1]
print(sorted(numbers))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
range(): Generates a sequence of numbers.


for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Output: 0 1 2 3 4
all() and any(): Return True if all or any of the elements of an iterable are True.


values = [True, False, True]
print(all(values))  # Output: False
print(any(values))  # Output: True
17. Lambda Functions
Lambda functions (also known as anonymous functions) are small, unnamed functions that are defined using the lambda keyword. They are typically used when a short, one-line function is needed.

Syntax:

lambda arguments: expression
Example:
python
Copy code
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8
Lambda functions are often used with functions like map(), filter(), and sorted().

Using Lambda with sorted():

data = [(1, 'apple'), (2, 'banana'), (3, 'cherry')]
data_sorted = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort by fruit name
print(data_sorted)  # Output: [(1, 'apple'), (2, 'banana'), (3, 'cherry')]
18. Recursion in Python
Recursion is the process where a function calls itself. It is often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems.

Recursive Example: Factorial Function

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
Recursive Example: Fibonacci Sequence

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(6))  # Output: 8
19. Modules and Libraries in Python
Python has a rich collection of modules and libraries that extend its functionality. Some of the most widely used libraries include:

math: Provides mathematical functions like sqrt(), factorial(), and cos().
random: For generating random numbers.
datetime: For handling dates and times.
os: For interacting with the operating system (e.g., file management).
sys: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions.
collections: Implements specialized container datatypes like namedtuple(), deque(), and Counter().

32.2 Dictionaries
Dictionaries store key-value pairs. Keys are unique, and values can be of any data type.


person = {"name": "John", "age": 25}
person["age"] = 26  # Modifying dictionary value
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 26}
This content provides a solid foundation for understanding the various concepts in Python programming.
33. Functions in Python
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It can take some inputs, process them, and then return a result.

33.1 Syntax of a Function

def function_name(parameters):
    # Function body
    return result
def: Keyword to define a function.
function_name: Name of the function.
parameters: Inputs passed to the function (optional).
return: Optional statement to return a value from the function.
34. Arguments and Parameters
34.1 Parameters
Parameters are the names specified in the function definition. They are placeholders for the values that will be passed into the function.

Example:

python
Copy code
def greet(name):  # 'name' is a parameter
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
34.2 Arguments
Arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called.

Example:


greet("Alice")  # 'Alice' is an argument
34.3 Types of Arguments
Positional Arguments: The arguments are passed in the order that the parameters are defined.


def add(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add(5, 3)  # 5 is assigned to x, 3 to y
print(result)  # Output: 8
Keyword Arguments: The arguments are passed by explicitly specifying the parameter names.


def add(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add(x=5, y=3)  # Specify the names of the parameters
print(result)  # Output: 8
Default Arguments: These are arguments that have default values. If no value is passed, the default value is used.


def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    print(f"{greeting}, {name}!")

greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice!
greet("Bob", "Good morning")  # Output: Good morning, Bob!
Variable-length Arguments:

*args: Used to pass a variable number of positional arguments.
**kwargs: Used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments.
Example:


def sum_numbers(*args):  # *args allows multiple arguments
    return sum(args)

print(sum_numbers(1, 2, 3, 4))  # Output: 10
python
Copy code
def print_info(**kwargs):  # **kwargs allows multiple keyword arguments
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

print_info(name="Alice", age=25)  # Output: name: Alice, age: 25
34.4 Return Statement
The return statement is used to send a result from the function back to the caller.


def square(x):
    return x * x

result = square(4)
print(result)  # Output: 16
35. Recursion in Python
Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a problem.

35.1 Example of Recursion
A classic example is calculating the factorial of a number.


def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
Base Case: Stops the recursion when the base condition is met (n == 0).
Recursive Call: Calls the function again with a smaller value.
36. Python Built-in Functions for Functions
Python has several built-in functions for function operations:

lambda function: A small anonymous function defined using lambda keyword.


square = lambda x: x * x
print(square(5))  # Output: 25
map(): Applies a function to all items in an input list.

python
Copy code
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
result = map(lambda x: x * x, numbers)
print(list(result))  # Output: [1, 4, 9]
filter(): Filters the items of an iterable based on a function's condition.


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = filter(lambda x: x > 2, numbers)

Basic Concepts
Database: A collection of tables that organize data in a structured way.
Table: Stores data in rows and columns.
Row: Represents a single record in a table.
Column: Represents an attribute or field in a table.
Primary Key: A unique identifier for each row in a table.
Foreign Key: A key used to link two tables together.
Basic MySQL Commands
1. Database Commands
Create a Database

CREATE DATABASE database_name;
Use a Database

USE database_name;
Show Databases

SHOW DATABASES;
Drop a Database

DROP DATABASE database_name;
2. Table Commands
Create a Table

CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype constraints,
    column2 datatype constraints,
    ...
);
Example:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
);
Show Tables

SHOW TABLES;
Describe Table Structure

DESCRIBE table_name;
Drop a Table

DROP TABLE table_name;
3. Inserting Data
Insert Data into a Table

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
Example:

INSERT INTO students (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 20);
4. Retrieving Data (SELECT Command)
Select All Data

SELECT * FROM table_name;
Select Specific Columns

SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
Using WHERE Clause (Conditional Query)

SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Example:

SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 18;
Using ORDER BY (Sorting Data)

SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC;
Using LIMIT (Restricting Number of Rows Returned)

SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT number;
5. Updating Data
Update Data in a Table

UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
Example:

UPDATE students SET age = 21 WHERE name = 'Alice';
6. Deleting Data
Delete Data from a Table

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Example:

DELETE FROM students WHERE age < 18;
7. Constraints
Primary Key: Ensures that each record has a unique value for this field.

CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_name datatype PRIMARY KEY
);
Foreign Key: Links two tables together.

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT,
    student_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(id)
);
Not Null: Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.

CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_name datatype NOT NULL
);
8. Aggregate Functions
COUNT(): Counts the number of rows in a table.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;
SUM(): Calculates the sum of a numeric column.

SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;
AVG(): Calculates the average value of a numeric column.

SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;
MIN() and MAX(): Finds the minimum and maximum values.

SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;
SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name;
9. Grouping Data
GROUP BY: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.

SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name;
10. Joins
Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

INNER JOIN: Returns rows with matching values in both tables.

SELECT a.column_name, b.column_name
FROM table1 a
INNER JOIN table2 b ON a.common_field = b.common_field;
LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the left table, even if there’s no match in the right table.

SELECT a.column_name, b.column_name
FROM table1 a
LEFT JOIN table2 b ON a.common_field = b.common_field;
RIGHT JOIN: Returns all rows from the right table, even if there’s no match in the left table.

SELECT a.column_name, b.column_name
FROM table1 a
RIGHT JOIN table2 b ON a.common_field = b.common_field;
Common Data Types in MySQL
INT: Integer numbers (whole numbers).
FLOAT/DOUBLE: Floating-point numbers.
CHAR(size): Fixed-length character strings.
VARCHAR(size): Variable-length character strings.
DATE: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
TIME: Time in HH:MM:SS format.
DATETIME: Date and time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format.
BOOLEAN: True or False values (stored as 1 or 0).
SQL Clauses and Keywords
DISTINCT: Used to select unique values.

SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;
IN: Checks if a value is within a set of values.
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
BETWEEN: Checks if a value falls within a range.
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
LIKE: Used for pattern matching.
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE 'pattern';
IS NULL: Checks for NULL values.

SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL;
Example of a Simple SQL Database Operation
Assume we have two tables: students and courses.

Create Tables


CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT
);

CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(100),
    student_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(id)
);
Insert Data


INSERT INTO students (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 20);
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age) VALUES (2, 'Bob', 22);

INSERT INTO courses (course_id, course_name, student_id) VALUES (101, 'Math', 1);
INSERT INTO courses (course_id, course_name, student_id) VALUES (102, 'Science', 2);
Retrieve Data with Join


SELECT students.name, courses.course_name
FROM students
INNER JOIN courses ON students.id = courses.student_id;
Output:


name   | course_name
--------------------
Alice  | Math
Bob    | Science
