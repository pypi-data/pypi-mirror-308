/// admonition | Internal Functions
    type: warning
These functions are meant for use in other parts of the module. You *probably* shouldn't be calling these manually.  
If there's an endpoint method missing from the main [FloweryAPI](flowery.md) class, you should open an [issue](https://www.coastalcommits.com/cswimr/PyFlowery/issues) (or a [pull request](https://www.coastalcommits.com/cswimr/PyFlowery/pulls)).
