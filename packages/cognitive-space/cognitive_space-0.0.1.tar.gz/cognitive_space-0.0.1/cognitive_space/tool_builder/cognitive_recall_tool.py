        The Cognitive Recall Tool is designed to retrieve stored information from memory,
        emulating the cognitive process of recalling. This tool accesses encoded knowledge,
        experiences, and data, bringing relevant information back into active use when needed.
        It supports decision-making, problem-solving, and reasoning by providing timely access
        to previously learned information. The Cognitive Recall Tool ensures that the agent can
        efficiently utilize its memory to respond to queries, perform tasks, and adapt to new
        situations by referencing past knowledge.
