        The Cognitive Encoder Tool is responsible for encoding information into memory, 
        simulating the human learning process. This tool captures and organizes new data,
        experiences, and knowledge, storing them effectively for future use. It mimics the 
        cognitive process of encoding, where information from the environment is transformed 
        into a format that can be stored in long-term memory. This tool ensures that the agent 
        can learn from interactions, adapt to new information, and build a comprehensive 
        knowledge base over time.
