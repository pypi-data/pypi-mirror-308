Installation
=====================================

FULMAR can be installed conveniently using pip::

    pip install fulmar-astro

If you have multiple versions of Python and pip on your machine, make sure to use pip3. Try::

    pip3 install fulmar-astro


The latest version can be pulled from github::

    git clone https://github.com/astrojose9/Fulmar.git
    cd fulmar
    python setup.py install

If the command ``python`` does not point to Python 3 on your machine, you can try to replace the last line with ``python3 setup.py install``. If you don't have ``git`` on your machine, you can find installation instructions `here <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_.
