**FULMAR** is an open source Python package that was created to assist radial velocity follow-up programs by making the analysis of the light curves easier. It provides tools to correct stellar activity, to look for transits, to refine transit parameters, to estimate the amplitude of the corresponding RV signal, and to visually probe signals detected in RV.
Our tool aims at selecting suitable RV follow-up targets more effectively and making their analysis easier. It was build in a modular way, making new features easier to implement.
