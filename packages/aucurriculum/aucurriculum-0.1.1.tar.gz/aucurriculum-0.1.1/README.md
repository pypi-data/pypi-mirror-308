A Curriculum Learning Toolkit for Deep Learning Tasks built on top of [autrainer](https://github.com/autrainer/autrainer).

## Installation

To install _aucurriculum_, first ensure that PyTorch (along with torchvision and torchaudio) version 2.0 or higher is installed.
For installation instructions, refer to the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

It is recommended to install _aucurriculum_ within a virtual environment.
To create a new virtual environment, refer to the [Python venv documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

Next, install _aucurriculum_ using _pip_.

```bash
pip install aucurriculum
```

To install _aucurriculum_ from source, refer to the [contribution guide](https://autrainer.github.io/aucurriculum/development/contributing.html).

## Next Steps

To get started using _aucurriculum_, the [quickstart guide](https://autrainer.github.io/aucurriculum/usage/quickstart.html) outlines the creation of a simple training configuration
and [tutorials](https://autrainer.github.io/aucurriculum/usage/tutorials.html) provide examples for implementing custom scoring and pacing functions including their configurations.

For a complete list of available CLI commands, refer to the [CLI reference](https://autrainer.github.io/aucurriculum/usage/cli_reference.html) or the [CLI wrapper](https://autrainer.github.io/aucurriculum/usage/cli_wrapper.html).
