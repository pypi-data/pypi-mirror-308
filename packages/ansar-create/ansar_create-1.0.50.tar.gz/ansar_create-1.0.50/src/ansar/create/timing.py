This module defines the machinery that underpins the timer service
available at `Point.start`. There are three major parts:

- ``Tick``, a class deriving from Message, this is the metronome sent to
  countdown machine.
- ``CountdownTimer``, a class, runs in own thread this object accepts
  StartTimer messsages.
- ``timer_circuit``, a function, runs as custom routine, sends regular
  Ticks to CountdownTimer.

	composite key. The record is initialized with the ticks before
	expiry.

	Ticks are received from the timer_circuit and are used to decrement
	the active record. If this decements to less than 1 the record is
