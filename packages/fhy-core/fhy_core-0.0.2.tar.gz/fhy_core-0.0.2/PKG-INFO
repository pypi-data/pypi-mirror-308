*FhY* Core is a collection of utilities for *FhY* and other parts of the compiler.

| Utility                                  | Description                                                            |
| :--------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Identifier                               | Unique naming class with a non-unique name hint and a unique ID.       |
| Error                                    | Custom error registration and core errors for the compiler.            |
| Expression                               | General expression represented as an AST with a parser and printer.    |
| Constraint                               | General logical constraint.                                            |
| Parameter                                | Real, integer, orginal, categorical, and permutation parameters.       |
| Types                                    | Core type system for the compiler.                                     |
| Memory Instance                          | Extensible record for an instance of data in memory.                   |
