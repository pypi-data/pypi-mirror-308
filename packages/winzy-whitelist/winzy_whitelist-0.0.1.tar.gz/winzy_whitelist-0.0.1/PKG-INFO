Whitelist python created exe's to make them bat scripts.

## Installation

First configure your Winzy project [to use Winzy](https://github.com/sukhbinder/winzy).

Then install this plugin in the same environment as your Winzy application.
```bash
pip install winzy-whitelist
```
## Usage

Some orgs doesn't allow using exe created by python, this plugin will create and equivalent batch file that can be used.

usage: Lets say `winzy.exe` created by `pip install winzy` is not usable, do this to call it `wiz`

```bash
winzy wlist winzy --alt-app-name wiz
```

This will create a wiz.bat in the correct place and now you can use winzy using the new name `wiz`. If alt-app-name is not provided `winzy.bat` gets created.


## Development

To set up this plugin locally, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:
```bash
cd winzy-whitelist
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Now install the dependencies and test dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e '.[test]'
```
To run the tests:
```bash
python -m pytest
```
