## 0.12.1 (2024-08-19)

### Bug fixes

* Various bug fixes related to large results handling.

## 0.12.0 (2024-08-06)

### New features

* Added `initially_suspended` support for creating `compute_pool` objects.
* `stage.upload_file()` and `stage.download_file()` have been deprecated. Please use `stage.put()` and `stage.get()` instead.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue in long-running queries and large-results support when running in notebooks.

## 0.11.0 (2024-07-25)

(New features are dependent on Snowflake 8.27)

### New features

* Added client logging to the library to enhance debuggability
* Added `undrop` support to `Dynamic Table`, `Schema` and `Table`
* Enhanced `Grant` support
  * **Limitations**: We still don’t support `SHOW GRANTS ON`. Only `Grantees.role` is supported for grants.to (`SHOW GRANTS TO`)
* `create_or_update`, `delete`, and `undelete` are now deprecated and have been renamed to `create_or_alter`, `drop`, and `undrop`. This is done to match SQL syntax more consistently

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug in stored procedure generated code

## 0.10.1 (2024-06-26)

This version contains minor bug fixes.

## 0.10.0 (2024-06-24)

(New features are dependent on Snowflake 8.23)

### New features

* `Grant` APIs are now available
* `Dynamic Table` APIs are now available
* `Function` APIs are now available (only Service functions)
* Added support for Finalizers in DAG and tasks

## 0.9.0 (2024-06-10)

### New features

* `User` APIs are now available (experimental)
* `Role` APIs are now available (experimental)
* Management `Stage` APIs are now available (experimental)

### Bug fixes

* `with_managed_access` is now properly returned as a property of `SchemaResource`

## 0.8.1 (2024-05-31)

### New features
* `with_managed_access` is now an available boolean option in `create_or_update` for `SchemaResource`. This is equivalent to the [WITH MANAGED ACCESS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-schema#optional-parameters) clause in `CREATE SCHEMA`.

    Usage example:

    ```schema.create_or_update(schema_def, with_managed_access = True)```

* Added a `get_endpoints` method for `Service` resources that returns a list of endpoints for a given `Service`.


## 0.8.0 (2024-04-30)

### Breaking changes
* The `deep` parameter is removed from `fetch()` on `TableResource` objects. `fetch()` will always return detailed columns and constraints information of a `TableResource`.
* `create_or_update()` for `Schema`, `Warehouse`, `Database`, `Compute Pool`, resources will (for the time being) not work. `create()` on these resources will still work.  
* Creating tables using `as_select` will no longer carry over information from any source tables used in the `as_select` query.
* `data_retention_time_in_days` and `max_data_extension_time_in_days` properties will be inherited from schema or database settings when not explicitly set in a `create_or_update` statement that alters an existing table.

### New features
* The Cortex Search API endpoint is now supported.
* Large results are now supported.
* Long-running queries are now supported.
* Added `ServiceSpec` helper to infer spec type from provided string in `Service` resources.
