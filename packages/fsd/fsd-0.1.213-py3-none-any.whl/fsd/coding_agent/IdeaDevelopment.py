            "1.1 Existing Files (mention if need for this task only):\n"
            "- Detailed Implementations: Provide thorough descriptions of implementations in existing files, specifying the purpose and functionality of each.\n"
            "- Algorithms & Dependencies: Suggest necessary algorithms, dependencies, functions, or classes for each existing file.\n"
            "- Interdependencies: Identify dependencies or relationships with other files and their impact on the system architecture.\n"
            "- Asset Usage: Describe the use of image, video, or audio assets in each existing file, specifying filenames, formats, and their placement.\n"
            "- Modification Guidelines: Specify what modifications are needed in each existing file to align with the new development plan.\n\n"

            "1.2 New Files:\n\n"

            "File Organization:\n"
            "- Enterprise Setup: Organize all files deeply following enterprise setup standards. Ensure that the file hierarchy is logical, scalable, and maintainable.\n"
            "- Documentation: Provide a detailed description of the file and folder structure, explaining the purpose of each directory and how they interrelate.\n"
            "- Standard Setup: Follow standard setup practices, such as creating index.html at the root level of the project.\n\n"

            "- Image Specifications: Provide detailed descriptions of new images, including content, style, colors, dimensions, and purpose. Specify exact dimensions and file formats per guidelines (e.g., Create `latte.svg` (128x128px), `cappuccino.png` (256x256px)).\n"
            "- Social Icons: For new social media icons, specify the exact platform (e.g., Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn, Twitter) rather than using generic terms like 'social'. Provide clear details for each icon, including dimensions, styling, and file format.\n"
            "- Image Paths: For all new generated images, include the full path for each image (e.g., `assets/icons/latte.svg`, `assets/products/cappuccino.png`, `assets/icons/facebook.svg`).\n"
            f"- Project Paths: Mention the main new project folder for all new files and the current project root path: {self.repo.get_repo_path()}.\n"
            "- Critical File Check: Carefully review and ensure that all critical files are included in the plan such as `index.html` at the root level for web projects, `index.js` for React projects, etc. For JavaScript projects, must check for and include `index.js` in both client and server directories if applicable. For other project types, ensure all essential setup and configuration files are accounted for.\n"
            "- Creatable Files Only: Never propose creation of files that cannot be generated through coding, such as fonts, audio files, or special file formats. Stick to image files (SVG, PNG, JPG), coding files (all types), and document files (e.g., .txt, .md, .json).\n"
            "- Directory Structure: If any new files are added, provide a clear and comprehensive tree structure of the project ONLY ONCE at the end of your response. Do not repeat this tree structure if no new files are added.\n\n"

            "- Top-Notch Level: Ensure all UI-related files are of the highest quality and follow best practices for the specific tech stack.\n"
            "- Separate Styling: For each HTML file, create a corresponding CSS file. Apply this principle across all tech stacks (e.g., separate component and style files for React).\n"
            "- Modular Design: Implement a modular approach to UI development, creating reusable components and styles.\n"
            "- Responsive Design: Ensure all UI elements are responsive and work across different screen sizes and devices.\n"
            "- Accessibility: Incorporate accessibility features in all UI components.\n"
            "- Performance Optimization: Implement performance best practices for UI components, such as lazy loading for images and efficient CSS.\n"
            "Example:\n"
            "- For a new 'ProductList' component in a React project:\n"
            "  - Create 'ProductList.js' for the component logic\n"
            "  - Create 'ProductList.css' for component-specific styles\n"
            "  - Implement responsive design in CSS using media queries\n"
            "  - Add accessibility attributes (e.g., aria-labels) in the JSX\n"
            "- For a new 'contact' page in a traditional web project:\n"
            "  - Create 'contact.html' for the page structure\n"
            "  - Create 'contact.css' for page-specific styles\n"
            "  - Implement form validation in a separate 'contact-validation.js' file\n"
            "  - Ensure the form is fully accessible and works on all devices\n\n"

            "1.3Context Support\n"
            "If context files are provided, briefly mention:\n"
            "- Context support file: [filename]\n"
            "- Relevant matter: [brief description of relevant information]\n"

            "1.4 Dependencies: (Don't have to mention if no relevant)\n"
            "- Dependency Listing: Enumerate all dependencies essential needed for the task, indicating whether they are already installed or need to be installed. Include their roles and relevance to the project.\n"
            "- Version Management: Use the latest versions of dependencies; specify version numbers only if explicitly requested.\n"
            "- CLI-Installable: Include only dependencies that can be installed via the command line interface (CLI), specifying the installation method (e.g., npm, pip).\n"
            "- Installation Commands: Provide exact CLI commands for installing dependencies without including version numbers unless specified.\n"
            "- Exclusions: Exclude dependencies that require IDE manipulation or cannot be installed via CLI.\n"
            "- Compatibility Assurance: Ensure compatibility among all dependencies and with the existing system architecture.\n\n"

            "1.5 API Usage\n"
            "If any API needs to be used or is mentioned by the user:\n"
            "- Specify the full API link in the file that needs to implement it\n"
            "- Clearly describe what needs to be done with the API. JUST SPECIFY EXACTLY THE PURPOSE OF USING THE API AND WHERE TO USE IT.\n"
            "- MUST provide ALL valuable information for the input and ouput, such as Request Body or Response Example, and specify the format if provided.\n"
            "- If the user mentions or provides an API key, MUST clearly state the key so other agents have context to code.\n"
            "Example:\n"
            f"- {self.repo.get_repo_path()}/api_handler.py:\n"
            "  - API: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\n"
            "  - Implementation: Use this API to fetch current weather data for a specific city.\n"
            "  - Request: GET request with query parameters 'q' (city name) and 'appid' (API key)\n"
            "  - API Key: If provided by user, mention it here (e.g., 'abcdef123456')\n"
            "  - Response: JSON format\n"
            "    Example response:\n"
            "    {\n"
            "      \"main\": {\n"
            "        \"temp\": 282.55,\n"
