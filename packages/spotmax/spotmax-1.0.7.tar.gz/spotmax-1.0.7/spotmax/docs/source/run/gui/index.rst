Run SpotMAX from the GUI
========================

SpotMAX GUI is based on the `Cell-ACDC`_ GUI and it can be launched from the 
Cell-ACDC launcher. If SpotMAX and Cell-ACDC are correctly installed, run the 
command ``acdc`` to open the launcher. From the launcher, you can open SpotMAX 
GUI by clicking on ``4. Launch SpotMAX...`` button, as shown in the screenshot below.
