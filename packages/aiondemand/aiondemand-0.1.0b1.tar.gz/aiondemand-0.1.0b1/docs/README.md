# AI-on-Demand 

The [AI-on-Demand](https://aiod.eu) (AIOD) platform empowers AI research and innovation for industry and academia. 
At its core if the [metadata catalogue](https://api.aiod.eu) which indexes countless AI resources, such as datasets, papers, and educational material, 
from many different platforms such as [Zenodo](https://www.zenodo.org), [OpenML](https://www.openml.org), and [AIDA](https://https://www.i-aida.org/ai-educational-resources/).
This package allows you to explore all resources in the metadata catalogue through Python.
You can also browse the contents of the AI-on-Demand metadata catalogue through the [MyLibrary](https://mylibrary.aiod.eu) service.

## Installation
The `aiondemand` package is on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/aiondemand/):

```bash
$ pip install aiondemand
```

Tip: install your dependencies in a [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).

## Usage
You can directly access endpoints through the Python API, for example to browse datasets:
```python
import aiod

aiod.datasets.get_list()
```
And results will be returned as a [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/overview.html) dataframe (though the `data_format` may be used to get JSON instead):
```bash

```

You can even query the elastic search endpoints:
```python
aiod.publications.search(search_query="Robotics")
```
```bash
      platform platform_resource_identifier                                               name date_published                                            same_as is_accessible_for_free  ... relevant_resource relevant_to      research_area  scientific_domain  type  identifier
