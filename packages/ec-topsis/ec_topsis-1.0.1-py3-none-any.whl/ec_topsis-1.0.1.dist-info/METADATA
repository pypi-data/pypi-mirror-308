# EC-TOPSIS

## Introduction

This library introduces the **EC-TOPSIS** method, a novel criteria-weighting hybrid technique. Merging ENTROPY, CRITIC, and TOPSIS methods, this innovation establishes a weight range for each criterion, maintaining the uniqueness of each method. These ranges, bounded by lower and upper limits, produce multiple weight sets per criterion and various rankings. After several iterations, the results reveal the dynamic behavior of alternatives under varied weights. Contrasting traditional models that offer a single ranking, this method highlights positional shifts across iterations, granting decision-makers a more explicit, less uncertain decision-making pathway.

## Usage

1. Install

```bash
pip install ec_topsis

```

2. Try it in **Colab**:
