# Stepwise PWR XBlock Build Backend

This is a [PEP-518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/) custom Python 'build backend' for setuptools to transpile [swpwr](https://github.com/QueriumCorp/swpwr) React build assets before building the package.
This package is published to PyPi as swpwrxblock-build-backend, and is specified in the pyproject.toml configuration of https://github.com/QueriumCorp/swpwrxblock.

More:
This build backend is ultimately invoked during builds of openedx, from inside a Dockerfile build operation, running remotely on Github Actions. This backend
is designed exclusively for use in the Stepwise Math (Open edX) application stack, and is intended to pull, unpack, and transpile environment-specific ReactJS
builds for `dev`, `staging`, or `prod`, where `prod`is the default. The environment designation itself is determined by a bash environment variable, `ENVIRONMENT_ID`, that is added to the container build via a tutor plugin, ???

## What it does

1. backend.py implements the [PEP-518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/) API.
2. SWPWRXBlockBuildBackend.build_wheel() adds a static asset collection procedure designed by [Kent Fuka](https://github.com/kentfuka) that maps a traditional ReactJS app vite build to a traditional Open edX XBlock folder structure.

## How it works

1.  The backend is specified in pyproject.toml of https://github.com/QueriumCorp/swpwrxblock/
2.  The build system will call the backend to build the package:

         [build-system]
         requires = ["setuptools", "wheel", "swpwrxblock-build-backend"]
         build-backend = "swpwrxblock_build_backend.backend"

    where "swpwrxblock-build-backend" is this repo published to PyPi,
    and where "swpwrxblock_build_backend.backend" is the path to the module `backend.py` in this repo.
