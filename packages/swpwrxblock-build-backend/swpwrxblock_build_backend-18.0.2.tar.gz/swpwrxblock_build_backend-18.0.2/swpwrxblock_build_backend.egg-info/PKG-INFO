# Stepwise PWR XBlock Build Backend

This is a [PEP-518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/) custom Python 'build backend' for setuptools to transpile swpwr React build assets before building the package.
This package is published to PyPi as swpwrxblock-build-backend, and is specified in the pyproject.toml configuration of https://github.com/QueriumCorp/swpwrxblock.

## What it does

1. backend.py implements the [PEP-518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/) API.
2. SWPWRXBlockBuildBackend.build_wheel() adds a static asset collection procedure designed by [Kent Fuka](https://github.com/kentfuka) that maps a traditional ReactJS app vite build to a traditional Open edX XBlock folder structure.

## How it works

1.  The backend is specified in pyproject.toml of https://github.com/QueriumCorp/swpwrxblock/
2.  the build system will call the backend to build the package:

         [build-system]
         requires = ["setuptools", "wheel", "swpwrxblock-build-backend"]
         build-backend = "swpwrxblock_build_backend.backend"

    where "swpwrxblock-build-backend" is this repo published to PyPi,
    and where "swpwrxblock_build_backend.backend" is the path to the module `backend.py` in this repo.
