the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
to be or not to be that is the question
all that glitters is not gold
an apple a day keeps the doctor away
better late than never
curiosity killed the cat
birds of a feather flock together
actions speak louder than words
a picture is worth a thousand words
dont count your chickens before they hatch
you cant judge a book by its cover
the pen is mightier than the sword
fortune favors the bold
absence makes the heart grow fonder
a watched pot never boils
barking up the wrong tree
burning the midnight oil
caught between a rock and a hard place
dont bite the hand that feeds you
dont cry over spilled milk
every cloud has a silver lining
a rolling stone gathers no moss
fools rush in where angels fear to tread
if it aint broke dont fix it
ignorance is bliss
it takes two to tango
let sleeping dogs lie
no pain no gain
once in a blue moon
out of sight out of mind
practice makes perfect
the early bird catches the worm
there is no place like home
time heals all wounds
what goes around comes around
when in rome do as the romans do
you cant have your cake and eat it too
a stitch in time saves nine
the squeaky wheel gets the grease
two heads are better than one
you cant make an omelette without breaking eggs
beggars cant be choosers
cleanliness is next to godliness
dont put all your eggs in one basket
hope for the best but prepare for the worst
no use crying over spilled milk
the grass is always greener on the other side
you cant teach an old dog new tricks
the best things in life are free
a chain is only as strong as its weakest link
dont judge a man until you have walked a mile in his shoes
home is where the heart is
the devil is in the details
actions speak louder than words
all good things come to those who wait
beggars cant be choosers
better to be safe than sorry
dont cross the bridge until you come to it
dont put the cart before the horse
dont count your chickens before they are hatched
dont judge a book by its cover
every cloud has a silver lining
great minds think alike
it takes two to tango
look before you leap
misery loves company
no man is an island
out of sight out of mind
practice makes perfect
silence is golden
the early bird catches the worm
the grass is always greener on the other side
the pen is mightier than the sword
time flies when you are having fun
two heads are better than one
when the going gets tough the tough get going
you cant make an omelette without breaking eggs
you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink
where there is smoke there is fire
a penny saved is a penny earned
birds of a feather flock together
dont bite off more than you can chew
too many cooks spoil the broth
