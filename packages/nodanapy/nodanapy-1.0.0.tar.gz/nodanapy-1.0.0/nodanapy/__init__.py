## NodAnaPy

This packages designed to determine the Nodal Analysis of the gas or oil well.

### Key Features:

- Calculate hold-up liquid
- Calculate inflow performance relationship
- Calculate vertical lift performance

### Modules:

- ipr: Classes to determine inflow performance relationship
- vlp: Classes to determine vertical lift performance
- _properties: Classes to calculate the properties of oil, gas and water
- wellNA: File .py where it is located to determine nodal analysis
