# Correct start_time greater than end_time

This script will go through all schedules whose start_time is after its end_time and add 1 hour to them.
This is useful to correct cases generated by a DST issue.

*Used and tested in mediaset*.


# How to use

1. Copy .env.template as .env
2. Fill in MONGO_URI parameter
3. Optionally fill in START_TIME and END_TIME (which will do a prefilter to only modify schedules within a certain period, i.e.: the day of the DST change)
4. Specify the format of the previous fields in DATETIME_FORMAT (by default: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
5. **Note**: Datetimes are in UTC (since we store them as UTC in the database).
