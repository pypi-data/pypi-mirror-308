# Recalculate aggregations

We have some problems with aggregations in the past. With this script you can regenerate the aggregations for all the 
AvWorks that have cues in the cuesheet but aggregations not completed.

It also will auto approve the avworks with higher `identified_music_ratio` than the `APPROVAL_RATIO`
