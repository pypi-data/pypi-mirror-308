# get_av_work_info_for_date_range

This script generates a CSV report with AvWork info from a date range.

## How it works

Takes a date range as input.

Fetches all schedules aired in between the date range.

It then generates a CSV report with the following info:

- Air date
- Title
- Program ID

## How to make it work

Duplicate the `.env.template`, name it as `.env` and fill the env variables for your use case.
