During the interactive lectures of the OTC 2025 shore-based course, you will
need to install tools and libraries for reading, processing and visualizing
data.

To make sure all students get the same environment, a bundle containing
SEAScope, Python 3.12.6 and additional material required by some lectures has
been created.


Installation
============

To install the software bundle:

1. Locate a disk/partition with the most free space on your computer (software
   itself does not take much space, but data used during the lectures will
   require several gigabytes)

2. Create a new directory on that disk/partition, all the software and data
   used during the course will be stored in that directory.

   Note that moving the directory elsewhere or renaming it will create
   problems, so choose wisely (using a short and meaningful name such as
   ``otc25`` is recommended).

   This directory will be referred to as the "OTC directory" in the upcoming
   instructions.

3. Download the bundle corresponding to your operating system:

   - Linux: https://ftp.odl.bzh/odl/events/otc25/software/linux-otc25-bundle.sh
   - Windows: https://ftp.odl.bzh/odl/events/otc25/software/windows-otc25-bundle.bat
   - macOS (Intel): https://ftp.odl.bzh/odl/events/otc25/software/macos_intel-otc25-bundle.command
   - macOS (Apple Silicon [1]_): https://ftp.odl.bzh/odl/events/otc25/software/macos_silicon-otc25-bundle.command

4.  Save it in the OTC directory.

5. Open your file browser (or a terminal) and go to the OTC directory, then
   double-click on the bundle file (or execute it from the terminal).

   The installation of the bundle will start and will take several minutes.

   A message is displayed at the end of the installation process, explaining
   how to open a new terminal already set up for the training course.

Verification
============

The software bundle includes a small tool to check that the environment is
correctly installed.

To perform this check:

1. Using a file browser, go to the OTC directory

2. Go to the ``seascope`` sub-directory

3. Double-click on the ``seascope`` file (Linux), ``SEAScope`` shortcut
   (Windows) or ``SEAScope.command`` file (macOS).

   The SEAScope viewer will start and display a globe.

   Keep the viewer running, it will be used in the next steps.

4. In your file browser, go back to the OTC directory, there should be a file
   named "Terminal" with either the ``.sh`` (Linux), ``.bat`` (Windows) or
   the ``.command`` (macOS) extension.

   Double-click on that file (or execute it) to open a terminal.

5. In the terminal, type:

   .. code:: bash

      otc2025-check-environment

   It might take some time depending on your computer but at the end it should
   open a Jupyter notebook in your web browser, and the "OTC" letters should
   appear on the globe in the SEAScope viewer.

   Please follow the instructions mentioned in the notebook to determine
   whether or not the tests were successful.

6. Close the notebook in your web browser. You can also stop the SEAScope
   viewer and close your terminal.

   You're ready for the interactive lectures! :)

Additional information
======================

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The OTC environment installed with the bundle scripts are independent from  |
| your operating system and should not require any admin permissions.         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The bundle scripts modify some Python packages to make them compatible with |
| Python 3.12.                                                                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| In order to keep instructions simple for all the students during the        |
| lectures, the version of SEAScope included in the macOS bundles does not    |
| contain the macOS-specific features that are otherwise available when       |
| downloading SEAScope from https://seascope.oceandatalab.com.                |
|                                                                             |
| Please note that this change may invalidate some macOS-specific information |
| found on the website and in the user manual.                                |
