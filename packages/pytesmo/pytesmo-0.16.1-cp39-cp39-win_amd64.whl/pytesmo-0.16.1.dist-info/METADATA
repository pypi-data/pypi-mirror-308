pytesmo, the Python Toolbox for the Evaluation of Soil Moisture Observations, is
a package/python toolbox which aims to provide a library that can be used for
the comparison and validation of geospatial time series datasets with a
(initial) focus on soil moisture.

If you use the software in a publication then please cite it using the Zenodo
DOI.  Be aware that this badge links to the latest package version.

Please select your specific version at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.596422 to
get the DOI of that version.  You should normally always use the DOI for the
specific version of your record in citations.  This is to ensure that other
researchers can access the exact research artefact you used for
reproducibility.

Installation
============

This package should be installable through `pip
<https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>`__ which downloads the package
from the `python package repository Pypi <https://pypi.python.org/>`__.
However, pytesmo also needs some packages that depend on C or Fortran libraries (like ``netCDF4``).
They should be installed first with conda or mamba. We recommend installing `Mambaforge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge>`__.
Then the following command should install all dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    mamba install -c conda-forge 'numpy<2.0.0' scipy pandas netCDF4 cython pyresample

Afterwards ``pytesmo`` can be installed via pip.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pytesmo


As an alternative (e.g. if you want to contribute to the package), you can
clone the Github repository and install from source:

.. code::

    git clone https://github.com/TUW-GEO/pytesmo.git --recursive
    cd pytesmo
    mamba create -n pytesmo python=3.10 # or any supported python version
    conda activate pytesmo
    mamba env update -f environment.yml -n pytesmo
    pip install -e .

Supported Products
==================

Soil moisture is observed using different methods and instruments, in this
version several satellite datasets as well as in situ and reanalysis data are supported
through independent and optional (reader) packages:

- `ERS & H-SAF ASCAT products <https://github.com/TUW-GEO/ascat/>`_
- `SMAP <https://github.com/TUW-GEO/smap_io/>`_
- `GLDAS Noah <https://github.com/TUW-GEO/gldas/>`_
- `ERA5 and ERA5-Land <https://github.com/TUW-GEO/ecmwf_models/>`_
- `SMOS <https://github.com/TUW-GEO/smos/>`_
- `C3S SM <https://github.com/TUW-GEO/c3s_sm/>`_
- `ESA CCI SM <https://github.com/TUW-GEO/esa_cci_sm/>`_
- `MERRA <https://github.com/TUW-GEO/merra/>`_
- `Data from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) <https://github.com/TUW-GEO/ismn/>`_
    In case of the ISMN, two different formats are provided:
    An example of how to use the dataset in the pytesmo validation framework can be
    found in the "Examples" chapter.
    * Variables stored in separate files (CEOP formatted)
