              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Welcome to Byaldi
_Did you know? In the movie RAGatouille, the dish Remy makes is not actually a ratatouille, but a refined version of the dish called "Confit Byaldi"._

<p align="center"><img width=350 alt="The Byaldi logo, it's a cheerful rat using a magnifying glass to look at a complex document. It says 'byaldi' in the middle of a circle around the rat." src="byaldi.webp"/></p>

⚠️ This is the pre-release version of Byaldi. Please report any issue you encounter, there will likely be quite a few quirks to iron out!

Byaldi is [RAGatouille](https://github.com/answerdotai/ragatouille)'s mini sister project. It is a simple wrapper around the [ColPali](https://github.com/illuin-tech/colpali) repository to make it easy to use late-interaction multi-modal models such as ColPALI with a familiar API.

## Getting started

First, a warning: This is a pre-release library, using uncompressed indexes and lacking other kinds of refinements. The only supported model, currently, is the original PaliGemma-based ColPali checkpoints family, including `vidore/colpali` and the updated `vidore/colpali-v1.2`. Additional backends will be supported in future updates. Eventually, we'll add an HNSW indexing mechanism, pooling, and, who knows, maybe 2-bit quantization?

It will get updated as the multi-modal ecosystem develops further!

### Pre-requisites

#### ColPali access

ColPali is currently the only model of its kind. As it is based on PaliGemma, you will need to accept [Google's license agreement for PaliGemma on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/google/paligemma-3b-mix-448), and use your own HF token to download the model.

#### Poppler

To convert pdf to images with a friendly license, we use the `pdf2image` library. This library requires `poppler` to be installed on your system. Poppler is very easy to install by following the instructions [on their website](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/). The tl;dr is:

__MacOS with homebrew__

```bash
brew install poppler
```

__Debian/Ubuntu__

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y poppler-utils
```

#### Flash-Attention

Gemma uses a recent version of flash attention. To make things run as smoothly as possible, we'd recommend that you install it after installing the library:

```bash
pip install --upgrade byaldi
pip install flash-attn
```


#### Hardware

ColPali uses multi-billion parameter models to encode documents. We recommend using a GPU for smooth operations, though weak/older GPUs are perfectly fine! Encoding your collection would suffer from poor performance on CPU or MPS.

## Using `byaldi`

Byaldi is largely modeled after RAGatouille, meaning that everything is designed to take the fewest lines of code possible, so you can very quickly build on top of it rather than spending time figuring out how to create a retrieval pipeline.

### Loading a model

Loading a model with `byaldi` is extremely straightforward:

```python3
from byaldi import RAGMultiModalModel
# Optionally, you can specify an `index_root`, which is where it'll save the index. It defaults to ".byaldi/".
RAG = RAGMultiModalModel.from_pretrained("vidore/colpali-v1.2")
```

If you've already got an index, and wish to load it along with the model necessary to query it, you can do so just as easily:

```python3
from byaldi import RAGMultiModalModel
# Optionally, you can specify an `index_root`, which is where it'll look for the index. It defaults to ".byaldi/".
RAG = RAGMultiModalModel.from_index("your_index_name")
```

### Creating an index
Creating an index with `byaldi` is simple and flexible. **You can index a single PDF file, a single image file, or a directory containing multiple of those**. Here's how to create an index:

```python3
from byaldi import RAGMultiModalModel
# Optionally, you can specify an `index_root`, which is where it'll save the index. It defaults to ".byaldi/".
RAG = RAGMultiModalModel.from_pretrained("vidore/colpali-v1.2")
RAG.index(
    input_path="docs/", # The path to your documents
    index_name=index_name, # The name you want to give to your index. It'll be saved at `index_root/index_name/`.
    store_collection_with_index=False, # Whether the index should store the base64 encoded documents.
    doc_ids=[0, 1, 2], # Optionally, you can specify a list of document IDs. They must be integers and match the number of documents you're passing. Otherwise, doc_ids will be automatically created.
    metadata=[{"author": "John Doe", "date": "2021-01-01"}], # Optionally, you can specify a list of metadata for each document. They must be a list of dictionaries, with the same length as the number of documents you're passing.
    overwrite=True # Whether to overwrite an index if it already exists. If False, it'll return None and do nothing if `index_root/index_name` exists.
)
```

And that's it! The model will start spinning and create your index, exporting all the necessary information to disk when it's done. You can then use the `RAGMultiModalModel.from_index("your_index_name")` method presented above to load it whenever needed (you don't need to do this right after creating it -- it's already loaded in memory and ready to go!).

The main decision you'll have to make here is whether you want to set `store_collection_with_index` to True or not. If set to true, it greatly simplifies your workflow: the base64-encoded version of relevant documents will be returned as part of the query results, so you can immediately pipe it to your LLM. However, it adds considerable memory and storage requirements to your index, so you might want to set it to False (the default setting) if you're short on those resources, and create the base64 encoded versions yourself whenever needed.


### Searching

Once you've created or loaded an index, you can start searching for relevant documents. Again, it's a single, very straightforward command:

```python3
results = RAG.search(query, k=3)
```

Results will be a list of `Result` objects, which you can also treat as normal dictionaries. Each result will be in this format:
```python3
[
    {
        "doc_id": 0,
        "page_num": 10,
        "score": 12.875,
        "metadata": {},
        "base64": None
    },
    ...
]
```

`page_num` are 1-indexed, while doc_ids are 0-indexed. This is to make simpler to operate with other PDF manipulation tools, where the 1st page is generally page 1. `page_num` for images and single-page PDFs will always be 1, it's only useful for longer PDFs.

If you've passed metadata or encoded with the flag to store the base64 versions, these fields will be populated. Results are sorted by score, so item 0 from the list will always be the most relevant document, etc...

### Adding documents to an existing index

Since indexes are in-memory, they're addition-friendly! If you need to ingest some new pdfs, just load your index with `from_index`, and then, call `add_to_index`, with similar parameters to the original `index()` method:

```python3
RAG.add_to_index("path_to_new_docs",
        store_collection_with_index: bool = False,
        ...
    )
```
